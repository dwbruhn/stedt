modified TableKit so hitting Escape and clicking outside will cancel.

2008.04.30
Notes editor now has in-place preview. Just click the "Save" button for some javascript magic!
Notes can be reordered using drag and drop (using scriptaculous Sortable).

2008.04.27
Fixed over 700 items whose lgid had been set to 0 accidentally
	in the mysql migration. This is because either the srcabbr or lgabbr
	had funny characters in it.
Factored out common code into TableEdit.pm.
Fixed various bugs and made various improvements in the process.
Counting rows is now accurate; hopefully speed is improved.
Also added ability to create records.
Now using TableKit 1.3b, to refresh table after adding rows.
Sorting columns by javascript now goes ascending first:
	TableKit.options.defaultSort = 1;
Made width of edit-in-place match the table cells, under edit : function(cell)
	field.setStyle({'width': cell.getWidth() + 'px'});

2007.08.11
implemented searching by arbitrary SQL WHERE clause in notes editor

2007.06.10
ability to sort columns in lexicon view

2007.06.02
fixed srcid field in lexicon table
fixed grpno field in languagegroups table
fixed rebuild_hashes script (was incorrectly excluding certain lexicon records due to operator precedence carelessness(?))

2007.04.01
more etyma cleanup. got rid of duplicate records, tag numbers are now unique.
added HPTB table and cgi script, removed those from etyma.
hptb.pl can search for all potentially equivalent hptb forms
  (based on protoglosses and etyma tags) given a chapter number.

2007.03.31
cleaned up etyma table. migrated overlooked data from FileMaker.
cleaned up notes table. got rid of bitrot (AN, GL, RE were used as overflow in FoxPro!). Fixed encoding issues on over a hundred glosses (probably not too important, but whatever).
now use comma to search for a list of things (OR search)
added chapters.pl
finished notes.pl, now it converts XML to a handier markup format

2006.10.30
- implemented our own sorting to work around mysql bug
- printing lex items

2006.03.19
fixed - now encodes < > & " as HTML entities in non-form items (CGI.pm automatically does this for form items); cf rn 148315
added protolanguage popup menu
now limits the number of results for each page (100) so your browser doesn't choke if you accidentally try to download the whole database; click the buttons to go to the next/prev pages
printing etyma now pops up a new window with up to 2000 items
fixed potential problem in analysis field search if spaces are present (used to assume tags had no space chars next to them, only commas)
you can now type '0' to search for non-tagged items in the lexicon
added subgroup popup menu
