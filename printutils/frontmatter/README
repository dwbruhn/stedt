The files in this directory constitute the "front matter" for the STEDT.  They are copied by the other fascicle building scripts 
to the working directory where they are "compiled" by LaTeX into the final product.

The versions here are the ones that should be edited!

A helper script to make a PDF of just the front matter lives here, and generates two types of "realistic" output,
(i.e. including everything that would be included in the final product -- the images (tree diagrams, flowcharts), etc.)

So, to generate a "one column PDF", more easily proofread, enter:

$ ./makeFrontMatter.sh 1col

To generate a "2 column PDF", more like what we think the final product will look like, enter:

$ ./makeFrontMatter.sh 2col

In either case, a pdf named "frontmatter1col.pdf" or "frontmatter2col.pdf" is created in the disExperiment1/tex directory (where, for now, all such fascicular pdfs are created).
