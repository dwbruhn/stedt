%{This expression refers to the study practices of two celebrated young scholars: \textit{Sūn Jı̀ng} \TC{孫敬} of the Han Dynasty would tie his hair to a roof-beam to avoid dozing off, while \textit{Sū Qı́n} \TC{蘇秦} of the Warring States period would keep himself awake by pricking his thigh with an awl. Both later had distinguished careers. At STEDT we have been inspired by their example.}
