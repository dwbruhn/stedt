\section{Apropos Sino-Tibetan and the STEDT project}

This Front Matter includes material from a number of previous publications and oral presentations: HPTB, TBRS, VSTB, ICSTLL 46.

The Sino-Tibetan (ST) language family, comprising Chinese on the one hand,
and the hundreds of Tibeto-Burman (TB) languages on the other, is one of the
largest in the world, with well over a billion and a half
speakers.\footnote{Some scholars, especially in China,
consider Sino-Tibetan to include the
Tai-Kadai (TK) and Hmong-Mien (HM) (=Miáo-Yáo) language families as well.  While
there is definitely a striking typological similarity among Chinese, TK, and HM,
this is undoubtedly due to prolonged ancient contact rather than genetic
relationship.  See Benedict 1975a (\textit{Austro-Thai Language and Culture, with a
glossary of roots}).}  Yet the field of ST linguistics is only about 70 years
old, and many TB languages remain virtually unstudied.  The \textit{Sino-Tibetan
Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus} project (STEDT) was begun in August 1987,
with the goal of reconstructing the lexicon of Proto-Sino-Tibetan and
Proto-Tibeto-Burman from both the phonological and the semantic point of view.

The great Sino-Tibetan language family, comprising Chinese on the one hand and Tibeto-Burman (TB) on the other,\footnote{Many scholars, especially in China, interpret ``Sino-Tibetan'' to include the Tai and Hmong-Mien families as well, though a consensus is developing that these latter two families, while possibly related to each other, have only an ancient contact relationship with Chinese (Benedict 1975a; JAM 1991a:486-90).} is comparable in time-depth and internal diversity to Indo-European, and equally important in the context of world civilization. The overwhelming cultural and numerical predominance of Chinese is counterbalanced by the sheer number of languages (some 250-300) in the TB branch.

After the existence of this vast and ramified family of languages was posited in the mid-19th century, British scholars and colonial administrators in India and Burma began to study some of the dozens of little-known ``tribal'' languages of the region that seemed to be genetically related to the two major literary languages, Tibetan and Burmese. This early work was collected in the monumental Linguistic Survey of India (Grierson and Konow 1903-28), three sections of which (Vol. III, Parts 1,2,3) are devoted to wordlists and brief texts from TB languages.

Further significant progress in TB studies had to wait until the late 1930's, when the eccentric amateur comparativist Robert Shafer headed a Depression-era project called ``Sino-Tibetan Linguistics'', sponsored by the eminent anthropologist A.L. Kroeber of U.C. Berkeley.\footnote{For a readable and humorous account of this project, see Benedict 1975b (LTBA 2.1:81-92).} With admirable thoroughness, the project staff assembled all the lexical material then available on TB languages, enabling Shafer to venture a detailed subgrouping of the family at different taxonomic levels, called (from higher to lower) divisions, sections, branches, units, languages, and dialects. This work was finally published piecemeal in a two-volume, five-part opus called Introduction to Sino-Tibetan (1966-67; 1974).

Shafer's junior collaborator Paul K. Benedict based his own work on the same body of material as Shafer, but achieved much more usable results. In an unpublished manuscript entitled Sino-Tibetan: a Conspectus (ca. 1942-43; henceforth STC), Benedict adopted a more modest approach to supergrouping and subgrouping than Shafer, stressing that many TB languages had so far resisted precise classification. While Shafer had included Tai in Sino-Tibetan, Benedict (1942) banished it from the family altogether, relating Tai instead to Austronesian.\footnote{To this putative megalolinguistic grouping, later to include Hmong-Mien and Japanese as well as Tai-Kadai and Austronesian, Benedict gave the name ``Austro-T(h)ai'' (see Benedict 1975a, 1990).} Shafer's pioneering work, valuable as it was, suffered from his mistrust of phonemics, with a consequent proliferation of pseudo-precise and arcane phonetic symbols. Benedict's structural insight  his flair for isolating that which is crucial from masses of data  enabled him to formulate sound correspondences with greater precision, and to distinguish between regular and exceptional phonological developments.

The publication of a revised and heavily annotated version of STC in 1972, with J. Matisoff as contributing editor, laid the foundations for modern Sino-Tibetan historical/ comparative linguistics. In this recension, nearly 700 Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) roots were reconstructed (491 of them in numbered cognate sets, with about 200 more scattered throughout the text and footnotes), as well as some 325 comparisons of PTB roots with Old Chinese etyma, largely as reconstructed by Karlgren (1957). While Benedict focussed principally on five key, phonologically conservative TB languages (Tibetan, Burmese, Lushai [=Mizo], Kachin [=Jingpho], Garo), he also used data from more than 100 others, judiciously making allowances for inadequacies of transcription where necessary.\footnote{In a recently published work, Peiros and Starostin (1996) follow Benedict' s example in their choice of key TB languages, basing their Sino-Tibetan reconstructions on Written Tibetan, Written Burmese, Lushai, Jingpho, and Chinese, all of which are treated as if they belonged on the same taxonomic level. See the discussion in Handel (1998, Ch. 3).} the moment of writing (September, 1997) marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of STC in 1972. The recent tragic death of Benedict in a car accident (July 21, 1997) makes this a particularly appropriate time to take stock. How well has STC stood the test of time? The short answer is: remarkably well. The work has been reviewed about 15 times, almost always in a highly favorable tone,\footnote{A notable exception is the intemperate review by Miller (1974), which bitterly criticizes the fact that the notes added in 1972 sometimes modify points made in the original text (ca. 1942). See the defense of STC against Miller's attack by JAM (1975a).} and has been translated into Chinese.\footnote{See Le Saiyue and Luo Meizhen 1984.}In fact nearly all 700 of the TB cognate sets in STC have been shown to be perfectly valid, though many of the reconstructions have had to be changed slightly in the light of new data, and in a couple of cases etyma which had been reconstructed separately have been shown to be variant forms (``allofams'') of the same word-family.\footnote{E.g. *dyam \& *tyam [STC $\#$226] `full; fill' and *dyam [STC $\#$227] `straight' ; see JAM 1988a.}

\section{Original plan of STEDT}
As originally conceived, STEDT was to produce a series of large
print volumes, each devoted to the exhaustive presentation of the reconstructed
roots in a specific semantic area, covering the entire lexicon, approximately as
follows:

\begin{quote}
{\footnotesize
Volume I: \textit{Body Parts}\nopagebreak[4]\\
Volume II: \textit{Animals}\\
Volume III: \textit{Natural Objects, Plants, Foods }\\
Volume IV: \textit{Kinship Terms, Ethnonyms, Social Roles}\\
Volume V: \textit{Culture, Artifacts, Religion}\\
Volume VI: \textit{Verbs of Motion, of Manipulation, and of Production}\\
Volume VII: \textit{Adjectival Verbs}\\
Volume VIII: \textit{Abstract Nouns and Verbs, Psychological Verbs, Verbs of Utterance }\\
Volume IX: \textit{Shape, Size, Color, Measure, Number, Time, Space}\\
Volume X: \textit{Grammatical words}\\
}
\end{quote}

Each volume was in turn to be divided into a number of smaller units called
“fascicles”. Thus Vol.~I \textit{Body Parts} was to comprise the following nine
fascicles:

\begin{quote}
{\footnotesize
1. \textit{Body (general)}\\
2. \textit{Head and Face}\\
3. \textit{Mouth and Throat}\\
4. \textit{Torso}\\
5. \textit{Limbs, Joints, and Body Measures}\\
6. \textit{Diffuse Organs}\\
7. \textit{Internal Organs}\\
8. \textit{Secretions and Somatophonics}\footnote{By “somatophonics” I mean sneezes,
belches, farts, and the like.}\\
9. \textit{Reproductive System}\\
}
\end{quote}

Every subpart and sub-subpart of the lexicon expanded and bloomed into a major project. Concentrated on NBP's --- TBRS was fascicle 9 of Vol. I.

Comparison with HPTB: In HPTB the etyma were discussed, sorted and analyzed according to their phonological shapes, regardless of their meanings.

Comparison with VSTB and TBRS: phonologically disparate etyma assembled according to their meanings. This is also the strategy of our Root Canal extractions:

[[INSERT JIM'S PROSE]]

\subsection{Subgroup names}


Tibeto-Burman is an extremely complex language family, with great internal
typological diversity, comparable to that of modern Indo-European.  This
diversity is due largely to millennia of language contact, especially with the
prestigious cultures of India and China,\footnote{I have called the Indian and
Chinese areas of linguistic and cultural influence the \textit{Indosphere} and the
\textit{Sinosphere}. See Matisoff 1973.} but also with the other
great language families of Southeast Asia (Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai,
Hmong-Mien), as well as with other TB groups.  We are thus faced with what I
have described as “an interlocking network of fuzzy-edged clots of languages,
emitting waves of mutual influence from their various nuclear ganglia.  A mess,
in other words.”\footnote{Matisoff 1978 (\textit{VSTB}), p.~2.}  While subgrouping such
a recalcitrant family is difficult, there is certainly no need to go so far as
van Driem by denying that TB subgroups exist at all, or by claiming that even if
they do exist, there are so many of them that there is no point in talking about
them!\footnote{See his review (2003) of G. Thurgood \& R.J. LaPolla, eds. (2003),
\textit{The Sino-Tibetan Languages}.}


In the published version of \textit{STC} (1972),
P.\ K.\ Benedict wisely refrained from offering a pseudo-precise family-tree model of
the higher-order taxonomic relationships in TB, presenting instead a schematic
chart where Kachin (=~Jingpho) was conceived as the center of geographical and
linguistic diversity in the family.  See Fig.~1.

A simpler scheme represents the heuristic model now used at STEDT.  See Fig.~2.

\end{figure}

This diagram differs from \textit{STC} in several respects:\footnote{See \textit{HPTB}, pp.~5-6.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Karenic is no longer regarded as having a special status, but is now
considered to be a subgroup of TB proper.
\item Baic, hardly mentioned (under the name “Minchia”) in \textit{STC}, but later
hypothesized by Benedict to belong with Chinese in the “Sinitic” branch of 
Sino-Tibetan, is now also treated as just another subgroup of TB, though one
under particularly heavy Chinese contact influence. Both Karenic and Baic have
SVO word order, unlike the rest of the TB family.
\item The highly ramified Kuki-Chin and Naga groups have provisionally been
amalgamated with Bodo-Garo (=Barish) and Abor-Miri-Dafla (=Mirish) into a
supergroup called by the purely geographical name of \textit{Kamarupan}, from the old
Sanskrit name for Assam.
\item The important Tangut-Qiang languages (deemed to include rGyalrong
[=Gyarung =Jiarong] and the extinct Xixia [=Tangut]) were hardly known to Western
scholars at the time \textit{STC} was written (ca.~1942-3) or published (1972). It seems
doubtful that a special relationship exists between Qiangic and Jingpho, or
between Qiangic and Lolo-Burmese, as some Chinese scholars maintain.\footnote{A
supergroup called “Rung” was proposed by Thurgood (1984), into which he placed,
among others, some Qiangic languages, Nungish, and Lepcha.  This grouping was
based partly on shared “proto-morphosyntax”, and partly on nomenclature,
including the \textit{-rong} of \textit{rGyalrong},
the Nungish language \textit{Rawang}, and the Lepcha autonym \textit{Rong}.}
\item The Nungish and Luish languages are grouped with Jingpho (=Kachin).  Jingpho
is also recognized to have a special contact relationship with the Northern Naga
(=Konyak) group.\footnote{The \textit{Linguistic Survey of India}
(Grierson and Konow, 1903-28) recognized a “Bodo-Naga-Kachin” group,
an idea revived by Burling
(1983), whose “Sal” supergroup comprises Bodo-Garo (Barish), Northern Naga
(Konyak), and Jingpho (=Kachin).  Burling’s name for this grouping is derived
from the etymon \textbf{*sal} ‘sun’ (ult.\ < PTB \textbf{*tsyar} ‘sunshine’), one of a number of
roots which is attested chiefly in these languages.  See \textit{HPTB}:393-4.}
\item The somewhat idiosyncratic Mikir, Meithei (=Manipuri), and Mru languages are
included under Kamarupan.
\item The Himalayish (=Himalayan) group is considered to include Bodic (i.e.\
\mbox{Tibetanoid}) languages, as well as Kanauri-Manchad, Tamang-Gurung-Thakali,
Kiranti (=Rai), Lepcha, and Newar.
\item The relatively well-studied Lolo-Burmese group (= \textit{STC}’s “Burmese-Lolo”) is
deemed to include the aberrant Jinuo language of Xishuangbanna,
Yunnan.\footnote{Chinese scholars have further divided the Loloish languages of
China into six nuclei, although no attempt is made in this volume to distinguish
them.  In a recent talk (Matisoff 2007b) I examined Loloish tonal developments
and the fate of the PLB rhyme \textbf{*-a} in terms of this six-way grouping, with
inconclusive results.}  The Naxi/Moso language is quite close to LB, but stands
somewhat outside the core of the family.\footnote{I have grouped Naxi with
Lolo-Burmese proper in a supergroup called “Burmo-Naxi-Lolo” (Matisoff 1991c). 
On the basis of some shared tonal developments, I have also entertained the idea
of a special relationship between Lolo-Burmese and Jingpho, to which I assigned
the jocular designation \textit{Jiburish} (<~\textbf{Ji-}(ngpho)
+ \textbf{-bur}(mish) + (Lolo)\textbf{ish}).  See
Matisoff 1974, 1991c.}
\item The mysterious Tujia language of Hunan and Hubei (not mentioned in \textit{STC}) has so
far not been assigned to a subgroup.
\end{itemize}


Still, a schema like Fig.~2 hardly does justice to the complexity
of the problem of subgrouping the TB languages.  In particular, the “Kamarupan”
and “Himalayish” groupings are based more on geographical convenience than on
strong constellations of similar characteristics.\footnote{Several scholars have objected to the term Kamarupan,
largely on the grounds that it has distinctly Indo-Aryan connotations, which
might irritate TB groups.  See, e.g.\ R.~Burling, “On \textit{Kamarupan}” (1999; \textit{LTBA}
22.2:169-71), and the reply by Matisoff, “In defense of \textit{Kamarupan}”
(1999; \textit{LTBA} 22.2:173-82).  The only alternative term
suggested so far to refer to these
geographically contiguous languages collectively is the verbose “TB languages of
Northeast India and adjacent areas”.}
More detailed subgroupings are certainly possible, as in
STEDT Monograph \#2,\footnote{J.~Namkung, ed. (1996),
\textit{Phonological Inventories of Tibeto-Burman Languages},
pp.~455-457.}
which makes distinctions like the following:


\begin{quote}
\textit{Kamarupan}\\
- Abor-Miri-Dafla (=Mirish)\footnote{A well-defined subgroup of AMD has been
dubbed \textit{Tani} by J. Sun (1993).}\\
- Kuki-Chin\\
- Naga\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Konyak (=Northern Naga)\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Angamoid\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Central\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Eastern\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Southern\\
\hspace*{3ex}· Southwestern\\
- Meithei\\
- Mikir\\
- Mru\\
- Bodo-Garo (=Barish)\\
- Chairel

\textit{Himalayish}\\
- Western (Bunan, Kanauri, Manchad/Pattani)\\
- Bodic (Tibetanoid)\\
- Lepcha\\
- Tamangic (incl. Chantyal, Gurung, Tamang, Thakali, Manang, Narphu)\\
- Dhimalish\\
- Newar\\
- Central Nepal Group (Kham, Magar, Chepang, Sunwar)\\
- Kiranti (=Rai), including Bahing and Hayu\\
\end{quote}

\subsection{Scope and subgrouping of the TB family}

The exact number of TB languages is impossible to determine, not only because of the elusiveness of the distinction between ``languages'' and ``dialects'' , and the fact that a number of languages remain to be discovered and/or described, but especially because of the profusion and confusion of different names for the same language.\footnote{See JAM 1986a, and STEDT Monograph II (JAM 1996a).} At the present state of our knowledge we can estimate that the Tibeto-Burman family contains approximately 250 languages, which may be broken down into population categories as indicated in Table 1: there are 9 TB languages with over a million speakers (Burmese, Tibetan, Bai, Yi (=Lolo), Karen, Meithei, Tujia, Hani, Jingpho), and altogether about 50 with more than 100,000 speakers; at the other end of the scale are some 125 languages with less than 10,000 speakers, many of which are now endangered (JAM 1991b). Though much of the geographical area covered by TB languages has been chronically inaccessible to fieldwork by scholars from outside,\footnote{Very approximately, the distribution of TB languages by country is as follows: India 107, Burma 75, Nepal 69, China 50, Thailand 16, Bangladesh 16, Bhutan 9, Laos 8, Vietnam 8, Pakistan 1.} there has been a recent explosion of new data, especially from China\footnote{Among the most valuable of these new sources are Sun Hongkai, Xu Jufang et al. (ZMYYC; 1991), containing 1004 synonym sets in 52 languages and dialects; and Dai Qingxia and Huang Bufan (TBL; 1992), with 1822 synonym sets in 50 languages and dialects.} and Nepal.

As far as subgrouping this unruly conglomerate of languages goes, Benedict wisely refrained from constructing a family tree of the conventional type, presenting instead a schematic chart where Kachin (=Jingpho) was conceived as the center of geographical and linguistic diversity in the family. See Figure 1:Schematic Stammbaum of Sino-Tibetan Languages [STC, p. 6] The genetic schema now being used heuristically at the STEDT project differs from this in several respects.\footnote{The STEDT project' s working hypotheses regarding the subgrouping of individual languages may be  found in the indices to STEDT Monograph III (J. Namkung, ed. 1996:455-7). } See Figure 2:Provisional STEDT Family Tree
\begin{itemize}
\item Karenic is no longer regarded as having a special status, but is now considered to be a subgroup of TB proper.\item Baic, hardly mentioned (under the name ``Minchia'' ) in STC , but later hypothesized by Benedict to belong with Chinese in the ``Sinitic'' branch of Sino-Tibetan, is now also treated as just another subgroup of TB, though one under particularly heavy Chinese contact influence. Both Karenic and Baic have SVO word order, unlike the rest of the TB family. \item The highly ramified Kuki-Chin-Naga group has provisionally been amalgamated with Bodo-Garo (=Barish) and Abor-Miri-Dafla (=Mirish) into a supergroup called by the purely geographical name of Kamarupan, from the old Sanskrit name for Assam.\footnote{Issue has been taken with this term by Burling (1999), but see the reply by JAM (1999c).} \item The important Qiangic languages (deemed to include rGyalrong [=Gyarung=Jiarong] and the extinct Xixia [=Tangut]) were hardly known to non-Western scholars at the time STC was written (ca. 1942-3) or published (1972). It seems doubtful that a special relationship exists between Qiangic and Jingpho, or between Qiangic and Lolo-Burmese, as many Chinese scholars maintain. \item The Nungish and Luish languages are grouped with Jingpho (=Kachin).\footnote{The obscure Luish group, also known as Kadu-Andro-Sengmai, includes a few languages spoken by groups that were once exiled to a remote corner of NE India by the Rajah of Manipur. See Grierson 1921.} Jingpho is also recognized to have a special contact relationship with the Northern Naga (=Konyak) group. \item The somewhat idiosyncratic Mikir, Meithei (=Manipuri), and Mru languages are included under Kamarupan. \item The Himalayish (=Himalayan) group is considered to include Bodic (i.e. Tibetanoid) languages, as well as Kanauri-Manchad, Kiranti (=Rai), Lepcha, and Newar. \footnote{As part of a recent trend to purge TB language names of Indo-Aryan suffixes, specialists in Himalayish languages are no longer using the name ``Newari'' for this language, but rather ``Nepal Bhasha'' or simply ``Newar'' . Similarly, the language known formally as Magari is now preferably referred to as ``Magar.''}\footnote{Various other subgroupings have been proposed, e.g. ``Rungic'' (Thurgood 1984) and ``Sino-Bodic'' (van Driem 1997). See a critique of the latter by JAM (2000b).}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typological diversity of TB: Indosphere and Sinosphere}

The TB family, which extends over a huge geographic range, is characterized by great typological diversity, comprising languages that range from the highly tonal, monosyllabic, analytic type with practically no affixational morphology (e.g. Loloish), to marginally tonal or atonal languages with complex systems of verbal agreement morphology (e.g. the Kiranti group of E. Nepal). While most TB languages are verb-final, the Karenic and Baic branches are SVO, like Chinese.
 
This diversity is partly to be explained in terms of areal influence from Chinese on the one hand, and Indo-Aryan languages on the other. It is convenient to refer to the Chinese and Indian spheres of cultural influence as the ``Sinosphere'' and the ``Indosphere''.\footnote{See JAM 1990a (``On megalocomparison.'')} Some languages and cultures are firmly in one or the other: e.g. the Munda and Khasi branches of Austroasiatic, the TB languages of Nepal, and much of the Kamarupan branch of TB (notably Meithei = Manipuri) are Indospheric; while the Hmong-Mien family, the Kam-Sui branch of Kadai, the Loloish branch of TB, and Vietnamese (Mon-Khmer) are Sinospheric. Others (e.g. Thai and Tibetan) have been influenced by both Chinese and Indian culture at different historical periods. Still other linguistic communities are so remote geographically that they have escaped significant influence from either cultural tradition (e.g. the Aslian branch of Mon-Khmer in Malaya, or the Nicobarese branch of Mon-Khmer in the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean).

Elements of Indian culture, especially ideas of kingship, religions (Hinduism/Brahminism, Buddhism), and {\it devan\=agar\={\i}} writing systems, began to penetrate both insular and peninsular Southeast Asia about 2000 years ago. Indic writing systems were adopted first by Austronesians (Javanese and Cham) and Austroasiatics (Khmer and Mon), then by Tai (Siamese and Lao) and Tibeto-Burmans (Pyu, Burmese, and Karen). the learned components of the vocabularies of Khmer, Mon, Burmese, and Thai/Lao consist of words of Pali/Sanskrit origin. Indian influence also spread north to the Himalayan region. Tibetan has used {\it devan\=agar\={\i}} writing since A.D. 600, but has preferred to calque new religious and technical vocabulary from native morphemes rather than borrowing Indic ones.

What is now China south of the Yangtze did not have a considerable Han Chinese population until the beginning of the current era (Ramsey 1987, Norman 1988). In early times the scattered Chinese communities of the region must have been on a numerical and cultural par with the coterritorial non-Chinese populations, with borrowing of material culture and vocabulary proceeding in all directions (Benedict 1975; Mei and Norman 1976; Sagart 1990). As late as the end of the first millennium A.D., non-Chinese states flourished on the periphery of the Middle Kingdom (Nanchao and Bai in Yunnan, Xixia in the Gansu/Qinghai/Tibet border regions, Lolo (Yi) chieftaincies in Sichuan. The Mongol Yuan dynasty finally consolidated Chinese power south of the Yangtze in the 13th century. Tibet also fell under Mongol influence then, but did not come under complete Chinese control until the 18th century.

Whatever their genetic affiliations, the languages of the East and SE Asian area have undergone massive convergence in all areas of their structure  phonological, grammatical, and semantic.\footnote{An excellent recent study of such phenomena is Thomason and Kaufman 1988.}  Hundreds of words have crossed over genetic boundaries in the course of millennia of intense language contact, so that it is often exceedingly difficult to distinguish ancient loans from genuine cognates.

Teleo- and meso-reconstructionsthe current state of comparative/historical TB research is quite uneven. While some branches of the family are relatively well studied, to the point where ``mesolanguages'' have been reconstructed at the subgroup level,\footnote{See, e.g. Proto-Karen (Haudricourt 1942-5, 1975; Jones 1961; Burling 1969; Solnit, in prep.); Proto-Bodo (Burling 1959); Proto-Lolo-Burmese (Burling 1968, JAM 1969, 1972a; Bradley 1978); Proto-Tamang-Gurung-Thakali (Mazaudon 1978); Proto-Kiranti (Michailovsky 1991); Proto-N.-Naga (W. French 1983); Proto-Tani [Mirish] (J.T. Sun 1993).} large gaps remain  we have nothing approaching well-worked out reconstructions for such key subgroups as Qiangic, Baic, Luish, and Nungish. Still unclear is the exact genetic position of many transitional languages like Chepang, Kham, Lepcha, Newar (all lumped currently with ``Himalayish''), or Meithei, Mikir, Mru (close to the Kuki-Chin-Naga branch), or Naxi/Moso and Jinuo (close to Lolo-Burmese), or the mysterious Tujia of Hunan/Hubei. The position of the crucially important Jingpho language is undergoing reevaluation, with current opinion returning to the notion of a special relationship with the Bodo-Garo-Konyak group (Burling 1971, Weidert 1987).\footnote{Cf. the volume of Grierson and Konow (1903-28) called ``Bodo-Naga-Kachin.'' Elsewhere (JAM 1974, 1991c) I have discussed the pros and cons of lumping Jingpho and Lolo-Burmese together into a supergroup facetiously called ``Jiburish'' (Jingpho-burmish-Loloish).} It remains to be seen whether the large ``Kamarupan'' (NE India) and ``Himalayish'' groups are anything more than purely geographic divisions of the family, and if so what the internal relationships among their many parts might be.

Although it remains true that ``supergroups within TB cannot safely be set up at the present level of investigation'' (STC, p. 11), the same can be said of Indo-European (IE) after nearly 200 years of scholarly investigation. Thus while it is obvious that the closely related Baltic and Slavic languages constitute a valid IE supergroup, ``Balto-Slavic'' (just as, e.g. the Loloish and Burmish languages clearly group together as ``Lolo-Burmese''), higher order IE lumpings (e.g. ``Italo-Celtic'', ``Italo-Germanic'', ``Italo-Greek'') remain highly controversial, since patterns of shared innovations, or overlapping features of special resemblance, may be found between virtually any two major subgroups of the family.\footnote{See the discussion in JAM (VSTB) 1978a:3-12.}Meso-level reconstruction per se is not one of the goals of the STEDT project; nor does the project's reconstruction of PTB depend strictly on the direct comparison of meso-level reconstructions. However, such reconstructions are used when available in reconstructing roots at the Proto-Tibeto-Burman level. We therefore treat meso-level proto-forms as lexical data records, just like attested forms in individual languages. I follow Benedict in caring little for a chimerical methodological purity in this respect, and generally endorse his philosophy of ``teleoreconstruction'', by which salient characteristics of the proto-language may be deduced by inspection of attested forms in well-chosen languages from different subgroups, thereby ``leap-frogging'' the need for step-wise reconstruction.\footnote{This method must of course be applied with due caution, and I feel that Benedict applied it too loosely with respect to the vexed question of the existence of a reconstructible tonal system at the PTB level. See e.g. Benedict 1973 (``Tibeto-Burman tones, with a note on teleo-reconstruction'').} This in fact has been the only practical methodology for reconstructing TB given the uneven state of our present knowledge. It goes without saying that one's teleo-hypotheses are subject to constant revision in the light of new data at the level of individual languages or subgroups. As in all scientific inquiry, the process of formulating falsifiable hypotheses lies at the heart of the reconstructive enterprise. I feel that it is perfectly justifiable to ``take a peek'' outside a given subgroup in order to help one choose between alternative reconstructions that might be equally plausible on the basis of intra-group evidence alone.\footnote{Many of the features of W. French's excellent reconstruction of Proto-N.-Naga (1983) were motivated by extra-Naga evidence.} It is for this reason that TB evidence will prove to be so crucial in evaluating the multitude of competing reconstructions of Old Chinese.

\subsection{Language names}


Tibeto-Burman languages are notorious for the multiplicity of names by which
they are referred to. These may include the name they use for themselves
(autonym), as opposed to the name(s) other groups use for them (exonyms). 
Languages are frequently referred to by the principal town in which they are
spoken (loconyms).  Some exonyms are now felt to be pejorative, and have been
abandoned, thus acquiring the status of “paleonyms” for which “neonyms” have
been substituted.\footnote{The terminology for the various types of TB language
names was developed in Matisoff 1986a: “The languages and dialects of
Tibeto-Burman: an alphabetic/genetic listing, with some prefatory remarks on
ethnonymic and glossonymic complications.”  In John McCoy and Timothy Light,
eds., \textit{Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies},  pp.~1-75.  This article was later
(1996) expanded into a STEDT Monograph, with the assistance of J.B. Lowe and
S.\ P.\ Baron.}  A certain Angamoid Naga group call themselves and their language
\textit{Memi} (autonym), and their chief village they call \textit{Sopvoma};
but other groups use
\textit{Mao} for this village or its people (exonym), and either \textit{Mao}
or \textit{Sopvoma} (exonymic
loconym) for their language.  There is an older term \textit{Imemai} (probably an
autonymic paleonym) which refers to the same language and people.


Some names are used in both a broader and a narrower sense, both for a
specific language and for a group of languages that share a close contact
relationship.  The Maru, Atsi, and Lashi\footnote{Referred to as Langsu, Zaiwa,
and Leqi in Chinese sources.} (who speak Burmish languages) consider themselves
to be “Kachin” in the broad sense, and in this the Jingpho themselves seem to
agree, even though the Jingpho language belongs to a different TB subgroup.


In recent years cultural sensitivities have forced the abandonment of many
language names that had been well established in the academic literature.  The
important Central Chin language that used to be called \textit{Lushai} (a name which is
said to mean “long-headed”) should now properly be called \textit{Mizo}.
A Karenic group
that used to be known by the Burmese exonym \textit{Taungthu} (lit.\ “mountain folk”) now
prefers their autonym \textit{Pa-o}.  The Southern Loloish people
formerly known by the Tai exonym \textit{Phunoi} (lit.\ “little people”) should now be
called by their autonym \textit{Coong}.  Speakers of several TB languages of Nepal now
object to the Indianized versions of their names with the Indo-Aryan \textbf{-i} suffix
(e.g.\ \textit{Newari, Magari, Sunwari}), and prefer to omit the suffix, even though this
can lead to ambiguity between the names of the people and their languages
(\textit{Newar, Magar, Sunwar}).  The psychological dimensions of these issues are often
as fascinating as they are paradoxical.  Chinese linguists now feel that the
term \textit{Lolo(ish)}, widely used outside of China,
is offensive, and insist that the
proper respectful term is \textit{Yi}, written with the character \TC{彝} ‘type of
sacrificial wine vessel’.  Yet this is only a recent substitution for the
homophonous character \TC{夷} ‘barbarian; savage group on the fringes of the Chinese
empire’.

[[LUISH > ASAKIAN?]]


Naturally enough, what is true for the names of individual languages is also
true for the names of subgroups.  Some of this nomenclatural variation goes back
to differences between Benedict and his former collaborator and supervisor
Robert Shafer,\footnote{Shafer and Benedict collaborated on the Depression-era
\textit{Sino-Tibetan Linguistics} project at Berkeley (1939-40), which aimed to assemble
all data then available on TB languages.  The direct fruits of this project were
Shafer’s \textit{Introduction to Sino-Tibetan} (1967-73), 5 vols. (Wiesbaden: Otto
Harrassowitz) and the MS of Benedict’s \textit{STC}.  Benedict produced (1975) an
entertaining account of this seminal project in LTBA 2.1:81-92: “Where it all
began: memories of Robert Shafer and the \textit{Sino-Tibetan Linguistics} project,
Berkeley (1939-40).”} e.g.\ Shafer’s \textit{Barish} and \textit{Mirish} are the same as Benedict’s
\textit{Bodo-Garo} and \textit{Abor-Miri-Dafla}, respectively.  An important group of at least a
dozen TB languages spoken in East Nepal is known either as \textit{Kiranti} or
\textit{Rai}.\footnote{According to K.~P.~Malla (p.c.~2008), “\textit{Kirãt} is a loose label in Old Indo-Aryan for the cave-dweller, attested in late Vedic texts as well as in the \textit{Mahābhārata}.” Rai is “a Nepali word, linked to IA \textit{raaya} ‘lord’, given to the Khambu chiefs by the Gorkhali rulers in the late 18th century.”}
  An extreme example of proliferation is furnished by the well-established and
non-controversial group I call Lolo-Burmese, which has also been referred to as
Burmese-Lolo, Yi-Burmese, Burmese-Yi, Burmese-Yipho, Yipho-Burmese, Yi-Myanmar,
Myanmar-Yipho, etc.—and even Myanmar-Ngwi!


Bearing all these complicating factors in mind, an attempt has been made in
this volume to use maximally clear and consistent designations for the TB
languages and subgroups.


\section{Meso-Reconstructions}

Stepwise vs. teleo-reconstruction
Both techniques are indispensable. Benedict (1972) made brilliant use of “teleoreconstructive” methods by relying mainly on 5 criterial, phonologically conservative languages: Written Tibetan, Written Burmese, Jingpho, Lushai (Mizo), and Bodo. Teleoreconstruction sometimes involves peeking outside a subgroup in order to come up with a meso-reconstruction; i.e. making educated guesses. Thus final stops may sometimes be reconstructed for Proto-Karenic by looking elsewhere in TB. W.T. French (1983) used similar techniques in his reconstruction of some aspects of his Proto-Northern Naga. The main thing is to form precise and correctible hypotheses, i.e. hypotheses that can be tested.

In favorable circumstances (i.e. when the data are sufficient and the sound-laws are well enough known) we can reconstruct a given etymon at several subgroup levels. A few examples from our database:

\subsection{Language contact: loanwords vs.\ cognates}

We include reconstructions of a number of Indo-Aryan roots, if they've been borrowed into a large number of TB languages (esp.\ in the Himalayas and NE India).
Even when the donor language is not related to the receptor TB language, there may well be an accidental phonological resemblance between the form in the donor language and a similar genuine TB root. To facilitate recognition of loanwords, we have adopted the practice of including e.g.\ Nepali roots (identified as such) in our list of etyma if they have been borrowed into several TB languages.

\subsection{Special challenges for Sino-Tibeto-Burman etymologization}

\begin{itemize}
\item Relative lack of anciently attested languages: only Chinese, Tibetan, Tangut (Xixia), Burmese, Meithei, Newar, and a few others.
\item Monosyllabicity	—as opposed, e.g., to Austronesian, with juicy disyllabic roots (trisyllables if one follows Benedict’s “Austro-Tai” (1975).
\item Unevenness of our knowledge with respect to the various subgroups of Tibeto-Burman
\end{itemize}

Subgrouping issues: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Phonologically eroded forms in many subgroups 
\end{itemize}

This presents problems common to reconstruction in other mono- or sesqui-syllabic languages of mainland Southeast Asia (Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kradai, Mon-Khmer).
	
There are great differences among the subgroups with respect to degree of preservation of proto-entities. Contrast, e.g. Written Tibetan and Kuki-Chin on the one hand, to Loloish, Asakian, and Qiangic on the other. So it’s good to find languages which erode differently (e.g., Hmong preserves initials better, while Mien preserves finals better; Kadu preserves finals better while Sak preserves initials better). This differential preservation makes it exciting when you can show that WT brgyad and Lahu hí are perfect cognates for EIGHT.

Phonological erosion makes it tough to distinguish between phonologically similar etyma in the same semantic field:
		LOUSE *sar and *s-r(y)ik. What do you do with a form like ?? ?
		MIND/BREATH *sem and *sak
		MOUTH *mu?r and *muk
		FACE *s-ma?y and *s-mel
As an extreme example, we have reconstructed no fewer than 11 etyma meaning NECK/THROAT with initial velars or velar clusters:\footnote{This is perhaps further confirmation of the frequently noted tendency of words for these parts of the body to have “guttural” initials.} 1 \#389 *s-gwa-n ? *r-gwa-n NECK/NAPE (probably related to \#495 *kwa THROAT/NECK); \#481 *s-ke-k ? *m-ke-k NECK; \#486 *l-kok THROAT/NECK; \#488 *k-ro THROAT; \#489 *k/s-rok ? *k-ro? THROAT; \#491 *gre-k THROAT; \#493 *kak THROAT; \#494 *ka THROAT/NECK; \#3361 *go? NECK/THROAT; \#5651 *ku NECK/THROAT.
	Some of these putative etyma may ultimately be combinable (e.g. \#389 and \#495, \#481 and \#491).\footnote{ This classic problem of distinguishing co-allofams from reflexes of separate roots has bedeviled Tibeto-Burmanists from the beginning. Benedict (1972) hesitated before assigning *g-yak and *s-rak ASHAMED to two separate roots (\#452 and \#431); similarly with *m-da and *b-la ARROW (pp. 111-112 and \#449). I now believe that two separate roots I set up in GSTC (JAM 1985) actually reflect the same etymon, so I would now combine CATTLE/DOMESTIC ANIMAL *dzay (\#129) with ELEPHANT/CATTLE *tsa?y (\#143). In 1988 I tried to show that two homophonous roots set up in Benedict 1972 (*dyam STRAIGHT and *dyam FULL/FILL are actually one and the same root. For many similar examples, see JAM 2013.} It is necessary to constantly rectify one’s reconstructions in the light of new data (see below XYZ), and equally imperative to try to establish “sound laws” by finding parallel examples (see below XYZ).
	
	
	
\section{Sources and Source Abbreviations}

[[INSERT JAM TEXT]]

\subsection{Source abbreviations}

[[``true, in this volume, but not generally; even when identical]]

Each supporting form is ascribed to a particular source.  Many forms are
cited in more than one source in our database.  If the form is not identical in
different sources, we include them all.  This is especially useful in cases
where one or more of the sources might not be totally accurate phonemically, or
where subphonemic phonetic detail is provided. When the forms in different
sources are identical, the form only appears once, but there are multiple source
abbreviations, separated by commas.  Forms from well-studied languages
(e.g.\ Written Tibetan, Written Burmese, Jingpho) are likely to appear in several
sources used by STEDT.


The STEDT database contains forms from sources of many different kinds,
including:
\begin{itemize}
\item printed books, monographs, articles, especially dictionaries and grammars of
individual languages;
\item synonym lists (i.e.\ groups of forms from different languages with the same
meaning, but with no reconstructions provided), e.g.\ Luce 1986 (PPPB); Sun
Hongkai et al.\ 1991 (ZMYYC); Dai Qingxia, Huang Bufan et al.\ 1992 (TBL);
\item semantically based questionnaires solicited by STEDT from fieldworkers working
on particular languages;
\item monographs and treatises of an etymological nature, including works which
provide reconstructions at the subgroup level, e.g.:

\begin{verse}
Proto-Bodo: Burling 1959\\
Proto-Karenic: Haudricourt 1942-45/1975, Jones 1961, Burling 1969, Benedict~1972 (\textit{STC}), Solnit, in prep.\\
Proto-Kiranti: Michailovsky 1991\\
Proto-Kuki-Chin: VanBik 2003\\
Proto-Lolo-Burmese: Burling 1968, Matisoff 1969/1972, Bradley 1979\\
Proto-Northern-Naga: French 1983\\
Proto-Tamangic: Mazaudon 1978\\
Proto-Tani: Sun Tianshin 1993\\
\end{verse}
\end{itemize}


The abbreviations used in these source attributions are in general quite
transparent,\footnote{For a complete list of the source abbreviations that
appear in this volume, see the \textit{Appendix}.} e.g.:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
CK-YiQ	&Chen Kang, “Yi Questionnaire”\\
JZ-Zaiwa	&Xu Xijian, \textit{Outline Grammar (Jiǎnzhì) of Zaiwa}\\

JAM:MLBM	&J.~A.~Matisoff, “Mpi and Lolo-Burmese microlinguistics”\\
EJAH:BKD	&E.~J.~A.~Henderson, \textit{Bwo Karen Dictionary}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

The abbreviation “JAM-Ety” refers to my own etymological notes compiled in the
pre-STEDT era, derived especially from older, classic sources.  These specific
sources can easily be tracked down from the \textit{Bibliography}.

\subsection{Supporting forms in the individual languages}

[[margin notes: ``paper is not a problem electronically''; maryama fix for absolutely identical ones]]

The forms which support the reconstructions are cited according to the
notation of the particular source.  Although this policy of “following copy”
often leads to redundancy (see 2.7 below), since one and the same form in a
given language may be transcribed in a variety of different ways,\footnote{Cf.\ the
multiple transcriptions of the Written Burmese form for BREAST/MILK under
\textbf{*s-nəw}, \#53 below:  \textbf{no¹}
(ZMYYC:281.39); \textbf{nuí} (AW-TBT:327; \textit{STC}:419); \textbf{núi}
(WSC-SH:48); \textbf{nuiʼ} (JAM-Ety; GEM-CNL; PKB-WBRD);
\textbf{nui.} (GEM-CNL); \textbf{nuiwʼ} (GHL-PPB).
 For these source abbreviations, see the \textit{Appendix}. Similarly, cf.\ the many slightly different forms from the Bodic and Tamangic groups that reflect the etymon \textbf{*tsaŋ} NEST/WOMB/PLACENTA (\#103 below).} it seems preferable to a
policy of “normalization”, which might have the effect of losing some phonetic
detail that is captured in one source but not in another.

\subsection{Glosses of the supporting forms}


In almost all cases, the gloss given in each particular source is preserved,
unless it is so awkward or misleading as to require emendation.  Even if the
glosses in consecutive records are identical, the gloss is repeated for each
individual record, instead of using a symbol like the “ditto-mark”.  


If a gloss is too long to fit onto a single line, it is “wrapped” so that
the additional lines are indented under the first one.

\subsection{Chinese comparanda}

After the evidence for a TB etymon is presented, one or more Chinese
comparanda are often suggested in the interests of pushing the reconstruction
further back to the Proto-Sino-Tibetan stage.  For all of these comparanda
Zev J.\ Handel has kindly provided comparisons of the Old Chinese reconstructions cited
in Karlgren’s (1957) system with those of Li Fang-kuei (1971, 1976, 1980) and
William Baxter (1992),\footnote{Handel also contributed a detailed comparison
of these systems in his \textit{A Concise Introduction to Old Chinese Phonology},
which appeared as Appendix A to \textit{HPTB}, pp.~543-74.}
evaluating the plausibility of the
putative TB/Chinese comparison according to each of these systems.\footnote{Handel  also frequently refers to several other reconstructive systems for OC that are to be found
in the literature, e.g.\ those of W. South Coblin (1986), Axel Schuessler (1987),
Laurent Sagart (1999), Gong Hwang-cherng (1990, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2000), and Pan
Wuyun (2000).}   Handel’s invaluable contributions are marked with his initials “ZJH”. 
Comparisons between TB and OC etyma that are not explicitly ascribed to a
particular scholar are original with me, as far as I know.

\subsection{Notes}

Footnotes may appear at virtually any point in the text. They may refer to an entire chapter, to a semantic diagram, to an etymon as a whole, to a specific supporting form, or to a Chinese comparandum.

\section{Semantic diagrams}
\subsection{Semantic flowcharts}
[[INSERT JAM TEXT]]
Each chapter begins with a semantic diagram.  These diagrams, called
“metastatic flowcharts” in STEDT parlance, were first introduced in Matisoff 1978a (\textit{VSTB}),
and have been used subsequently in many of my articles.\footnote{See, e.g.,
Matisoff 1980 (“Stars, moon, and spirits”); 1985a (“God and the ST copula”);
1985b (“Arm, hand, wing”); 1988b (“Property, livestock, talent”); 1991a
(“Grammatization in Lahu”); 1991b (“Mother of all morphemes”); 1994b (“Buttock
and dull”); 2000b (“Three TB word-families”); 2004 (“Areal semantics”).}
They
are intended to represent the paths of semantic association undergone by etyma,
as established by comparative/historical and/or internal synchronic evidence. An
association between two points (X,Y) in semantic space may be established either
synchronically or diachronically, either on the basis of a single language or
comparatively.\footnote{As a desideratum for the future, one can envision
three-dimensional semantic diagrams like those used to model molecules in
organic chemistry!}  I rely on three basic types of evidence:\footnote{See the
discussion in \textit{VSTB}: 194-200.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textit{Synchronic intra-lingual vagueness.} A given daughter language has a single
form that means X or Y according to context, e.g.\ 
Mikir \textbf{artho} means either ‘blood vessel’ or ‘tendon’ or ‘muscle’ or ‘nerve’.
In many Chin languages reflexes of \textbf{*m‑luŋ} can mean either HEART or LIVER.
\item
\textit{Inter-lingual semantic shift of phonological cognates,} i.e.\ reflexes of the
same etymon mean X in Lg.~A but Y in Lg.~B, e.g.:\\
\hspace*{2ex}PTB \textbf{*r-kliŋ} ‘marrow/brain’ > Mikir \textbf{arkleŋ} ‘marrow’, Dimasa \textbf{buthluŋ} ‘brain’;\\
\hspace*{2ex}PTB \textbf{*s-pʷik} ‘bowels/stomach’ > Mikir \textbf{phek} ‘bowels’, Lahu \textbf{ɔ̀-\textit{fɨ́}-qō} ‘stomach’.
\item
\textit{Association via compounding.}  Three points (A,B,C) in semantic space are
related, such that in some language a compound of two morphemes, A + B, has the
meaning C.  In other words, an etymon appears as a constituent in compounds,
such that part of the meaning of the compound derives from it, e.g.:

FOOT + EYE $\to$ ANKLE (Lahu \textbf{khɨ-mɛ̂ʔ-šī} < \textbf{khɨ} ‘foot’ + \textbf{mɛ̂ʔ-šī} ‘eye’);
similarly Indonesian \textbf{mata-kaki} ‘ankle’ (< \textbf{mata} ‘eye’ + \textbf{kaki} ‘foot’), which
establishes the association EYE $\longleftrightarrow$ ANKLE\footnote{The same formation is
found in many other TB languages, e.g.:

\begin{tabular}{llll}
				&\textit{FOOT}	&\textit{EYE}	&\textit{ANKLE}\\
Lalung			&\textbf{ia-thong}	&\textbf{mi}	&\textbf{ia-thong-mi}\\
Limbu			&\textbf{lāŋ}	&\textbf{mik}	&\textbf{lāŋ-mik}\\
Lushai			&\textbf{ke}		&\textbf{mit}	&\textbf{ke-mit}\\
Meithei			&\textbf{khu}	&\textbf{mit}	&\textbf{khu-mit}\\
Tangkhul		&\textbf{phei}	&\textbf{mik-ra}	&\textbf{phei-mik-ra}\\
Written Burmese	&\textbf{khre}	&\textbf{myak-ci’}	&\textbf{khre-myak-ci’}\\
\end{tabular}}
\end{enumerate}

Certain conventions are observed in the metastatic flowcharts of this volume:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Points in semantic space between which an association has been established
are connected by solid lines.  If a point is a bodypart, it is labelled in
capital letters.  An association between two points that are both bodyparts is
an “intra-field association”, e.g.:

% \hspace*{0.7in} \XeTeXpdffile "../../pdf/intro21a.pdf"
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../../pdf/intro21a.pdf}}

\item If the association crosses into another semantic field (i.e., with respect
to this volume, if it is between a bodypart and a non-bodypart), the
non-bodypart point is labeled with small letters, e.g.:

% \hspace*{0.7in} \XeTeXpdffile "../../pdf/intro21b.pdf" 
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../../pdf/intro21b.pdf}}

\item Antonymic associations (cases where the etymon has acquired opposite
meanings) are diagrammed by a curved \textit{yin-yang} type of line, e.g.:

% \hspace*{0.7in} \XeTeXpdffile "../../pdf/intro21c.pdf"
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../../pdf/intro21c.pdf}}

\item Compounds are diagrammed by a pitchfork-like symbol, with the two
constituents appearing at the points of the fork, and the overall meaning of the
compound indicated at the tip of the handle, e.g.:

% \hspace*{0.7in} \XeTeXpdffile "../../pdf/intro21d.pdf" 
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{../../pdf/intro21d.pdf}}

\end{enumerate}

The same convention with respect to capital vs.\ small letters applies to
compounds. In cases where several different combinations of morphemes are attested in compounds with the same meaning, graphic constraints sometimes require geometric reorientations of the pitchfork, e.g.

% \hspace*{1in} \XeTeXpdffile "../../pdf/intro21d2.pdf"

The category of “reproductive bodyparts” is construed broadly to include
related verbs (e.g., KISS, SUCK, LOVE, SQUIRT). This volume also includes some
non-bodypart terms which frequently appear in compounds with etyma referring to
the reproductive system.  See especially Ch.~IX, “Body fluids”.


Deciding how much semantic latitude to allow among putative cognates is
definitely an art rather than a science. Here as elsewhere a middle-of-the-road
approach is necessary, neither overly conservative nor too wildly speculative.
As a positive example of a promising new etymology involving a semantic leap, we
may offer \textbf{*m-t(s)i} ‘salt~/ yeast’ [\textit{HPTB} 3.3.1].  Although forms in the daughter
languages sometimes mean ‘salt’ and sometimes ‘yeast’, the phonological
correspondences between both semantic groups of forms are good.  On the other
hand, the semantic association between ‘salt’ and ‘yeast’ has yet to be attested
in other language families, even though it has great initial plausibility. Both
are efficacious substances that have dramatic effects on the taste of food or
drink; their lack renders the food or drink insipid.\footnote{Yeast is used for
brewing liquor rather than for baking bread in East and SE Asia.}

In all language families, semantic associations/variation is much less structured than phonological variation. Sometimes the same unexpected semantic association is found in widely different language families, e.g. BRAIN and MARROW, exemplified both in IE and TB.\footnote{See JAM 1987 (VSTB), pp. 182-3, 203.} Other associations seem to be confined to a particular family, e.g. YEAST and SALT, so far discovered only in TB.\footnote{See 2003a (HPTB:34), and JAM 2003b. Yeast is traditionally used for brewing liquor rather than for baking bread in East and SE Asia. Both salt and yeast are efficacious substances that have dramatic effects on the taste of food or drink; their lack renders the food or drink insipid. Cf. Proto-Kuki-Naga *m-tsyi ‘salt’ and Jingpho m?tsì, Lahu dî ‘yeast’ (Lahu voiced initials come from *prenasalized ones).}

The vagaries of semantic history occasionally result in strange allofamic bedfellows, e.g. Eng. black and blank, from the same PIE root *bhel- (see above), or Eng. science and shit < *skei- CUT/SPLIT (AHD 58-9).

Given this unpredictability, how much semantic latitude is prudent in our etymologies, and under what circumstances can semantic leaps be plausibly justified? On the wild side we have megalo-comparative fantasies with implausible semantic associations offered which are totally unsupported by reasonable phonological correspondences or areal semantic tendencies, as in Jan Braun’s Sumerian and Tibeto-Burman (2001), in which he claims genetic connections between pairs of words like the following:
		Sumerian				Written Tibetan
		gim ‘axe’				h?gem-pa ‘destroy’
		alad ‘protective demon’		lad-mo ‘imitation’
		?inig ‘tamarisk’			snyigs-pa ‘degenerated; grown worse’
		pe? ‘three’			gsum ‘three’

Benedict 1939 was a pioneering article in the field of Southeast Asian areal semantics. At STEDT we have tried to make our semantic speculations as reasonable as possible. Each word in our lexical database is accompanied by a symbol which indicates the semantic field(s) to which it belongs. Within each point in semantic space, we attempt to trace the patterns of association for which there is evidence, by means of diagrams called “metastatic flowcharts” in our jargon.3 FIGURES 7A and 7B are two attempts to indicate the attested semantic associations of SKIN in TB/ST.

Clarification of STEDT’s reconstructions, especially with respect to prefixes.
The Index of HPTB lists the naked roots, stripped of prefixes and suffixes. One must look in the text to find the details. There has been an inconsistency in noting the nasal prefix:  *m- or *N- or *n-. This will be regularized during the “rectification” process (below VII).

·Not all morphological elements in our formulas are claimed to be of equal antiquity. The only claim is that the item has been attested someplace in the family at some time.  The rationale for setting up such an element (e.g. a prefix) is generally explained in an “etymon note” at the beginning of an etymology, E.g., in *m-p(r)(w)a? MOUTH: the *m- is only directly attested in Qiangic, Tani, and Southern Chin.


\subsection{Reconstructed PTB etyma}


After the semantic chart which begins each chapter, the reconstructed PTB
roots of the chapter are presented one after the other, roughly in the order of
the strength of their attestation.  After preliminary remarks about the
distribution of the etymon, the “supporting forms” for the reconstruction are
listed, subgroup by subgroup.


The reconstructions all conform to the syllable canon posited for the
proto-language,\footnote{See \textit{HPTB}, pp.~11-13.}

\begin{quote}
(P²)\hspace{2em}(P¹)\hspace{2em}$\textrm{C}_i$\hspace{2em}(G)\hspace{2em}V\hspace{2em}(ː)\hspace{2em}($\textrm{C}_f$)\hspace{2em}(s),
\end{quote}


where the initial consonant ($\textrm{C}_i$) may be preceded by up to two prefixes (with the
inner prefix P¹ assumed to be historically prior to the outer one (P²); the $\textrm{C}_i$
may optionally be followed by one of four glides (G), */-y-, -r-, -w-, -l-/, and
the vowel, which may be long (ː), may be followed by a final consonant ($\textrm{C}_f$); if
the syllable does contain a $\textrm{C}_f$, it may also (although quite rarely) end with
suffixal -s.  It should be noted that many daughter TB languages have much
simpler canons, e.g.\ Lahu, where native syllables consist maximally of an
initial consonant, a vowel, and a tone:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	&T\\
($\textrm{C}_i$)	&V\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

No attempt is made to reconstruct tones beyond the subgroup level, since it is
far from proven that a single system of tonal contrasts can be set up for PTB.  


Reconstructions at the subgroup level (i.e.\ “meso-reconstructions” like
Proto-Lolo-Burmese (PLB), Proto-Northern-Naga (PNN), Proto-Tani) are listed as
individual records along with their supporting forms.

A few notational conventions with respect to my PTB reconstructions should
be mentioned:
\begin{itemize}
\item Variant reconstructed forms are indicated in several ways.  They are usually
\mbox{written} with the “allofam symbol” \STEDTU{⪤} between them, e.g.: \textbf{*glim} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*glip}
BROOD~/ INCUBATE; \textbf{*s-riŋ} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*s-r(y)aŋ} LIVE / ALIVE / GREEN / RAW / GIVE BIRTH.
Sometimes, however, I use an alternative notation with parentheses, e.g.: \textbf{*(t)si}
COPULATE/LOVE; this is equivalent to \textbf{*si} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*tsi}.  Slashes may also be used,
e.g.\ \textbf{*p/buk} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*p/bik} BORN/GIVE BIRTH; this is equivalent to
\textbf{*puk} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*buk} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*pik} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*bik}.
Finally, still another way of indicating proto-variation is by means of a
“vertical reconstruction”, e.g.:

\begin{quote}
*\textbf{\begin{tabular}[c]{c}t\\d\\\end{tabular}uŋ}  NAVEL.
This means the same as \textbf{*tuŋ} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*duŋ.}
\end{quote}


\item Parentheses are especially appropriate for those frequent cases where there is
variation or indeterminacy between dental and palatal fricates; in fact that is
one of my principal motivations for writing the palatal series as sequences of
dental plus \textbf{-y-},
rather than writing them with \textit{hačeks} or grave accents, e.g.:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{*ts(y)uːŋ}	&NAVEL / CENTER		&(= \textbf{*tsuːŋ} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*tšuːŋ)}\\
\textbf{*s(y)ok}	&DRINK / SUCK / SMOKE	&(= \textbf{*sok} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*šok)}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\item Etyma which show variation between initial \textbf{*p-} and \textbf{*w-} are reconstructed with
the morphophonemic symbol \textbf{*pʷ-,} which is roughly equivalent to treating the stop
element as a prefix (\textbf{*p-w-}).\footnote{For extended discussion of this issue,
see Matisoff 2000a.}  Thus, a reconstruction like \textbf{*pʷu} EGG~/ BIRD~/ ROUND OBJECT
implies the existence of two sub-roots, \textbf{*pu} and \textbf{*wu,} whatever the ultimate
explanation for this variation might prove to be.

\item In the original version of Benedict 1972 (henceforth \textit{STC}, ca.~1943), Benedict reconstructed two PTB high
long vowels \textbf{*-iy} and \textbf{*-uw,} contrasting with the much less frequent short high
vowels \textbf{*-i} and \textbf{*-u.}  In the published version (1972) he modified the
reconstruction of these long vowels to \textbf{*-əy} and \textbf{*-əw,} a practice which I follow
myself.  Occasionally, however, when the evidence does not permit us to decide
between a long and a short high proto-vowel, it is convenient to revert to the
earlier notation, with parentheses, e.g.\ \textbf{*b-ni(y)} ‘petticoat’ (\textit{STC} \#476);
\textbf{*sru(w)} ‘relative’ (\textit{STC} p.~108).  There are no such cases among the etyma in
this volume, however.
\end{itemize}


For more discussion of variational patterns in PTB, see “Regularity and
variation”, section 3.1 below.


Many of the PTB etyma in this volume are here reconstructed for the first
time in print, and a good number of the TB/Chinese comparanda are likewise here
proposed for the first time.  If references are not explicitly given to \textit{STC}
and/or \textit{HPTB} in the introductory note for an etymon it may be assumed that the
reconstruction is new.\footnote{References to HPTB as labelled with “\textbf{H:}” followed by a page number, e.g.\ \textbf{(H:165)} \textbf{*wa} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*wu} BIRD / FOWL means that the root is discussed chiefly on page 165 of \textit{HPTB}.}

\subsection{Regularity and variation}


It must be admitted that a lot of guesswork is involved in etymologizing
material from hundreds of languages and dialects at once, without having
established the “sound laws” in advance. The problems are especially acute when
comparing phonologically depleted languages with those having richer syllable
canons. When there is a partial phonological similarity between distinct etyma
with the same meaning (e.g.\ \textbf{*sem} and \textbf{*sak}  ‘mind / breath’;
\textbf{*muːr} and \textbf{*muk}
‘mouth’; \textbf{*s-maːy} and \textbf{*s-mel} ‘face’;
\textbf{*s-r(y)ik} and \textbf{*s(y)ar} ‘louse’), it is not
easy to decide by simple inspection to which etymon we should assign a
phonologically slight form in a daughter language (e.g.\ \textbf{sɒ} ‘mind’,
\textbf{mɔ} ‘mouth’,
\textbf{hmɛ} ‘face’).


There is a dialectical relationship between synchronic data and sound laws.
The “laws” are derived by inference from the data in the first place, but once
proto-forms are reconstructed, they can be used to guide us in our hunt for
cognates in languages not yet examined (even if they have undergone semantic
change). Almost every TB/ST etymology so far proposed presents problems and
complications—irregularities—in some language or other, which is par for
the course even in the much better known Indo-European family. Part of our task
is to indicate where the exceptions, problems, and irregularities lie, in the
hope that they can ultimately be explained.\footnote{The computer can be very
useful in deciding between alternative etymologies. Once “sound-laws” have been
formulated, computer checking can test whether a particular reconstruction
follows the laws, identifying inconsistencies in the reflexes of the same
proto-element in a given language. Such a methodology has been applied to the
Tamangic languages, using the “reconstruction engine” developed by J.B. Lowe at
STEDT in collaboration with Martine Mazaudon and Boyd Michailovsky during their
sojourns at Berkeley as visiting scholars (1987-89, 1990-91).} The concept of
“regularity” itself is by no means simple, nor does it mean the same thing to
different scholars.\footnote{See Matisoff 1992 (“Following the marrow”) and
1994a (“Regularity and variation”).}


Those who lack what I have called “Proto-Sprachgefühl”\footnote{See
Matisoff 1982.} can produce abstract, formulaic reconstructions bristling with
strange symbols but devoid of any phonetic or typological
plausibility.\footnote{Recent examples of this genre include Sedláček
1970; Weidert 1975, 1979, 1981, 1987; Peiros \& Starostin 1996; Sagart 2007.} 
Given sufficient semantic latitude and proto-forms that are complex enough, one
can formulate “sound laws” in such a way that they appear completely regular and
exceptionless.  At an extreme level we find “megalocomparative” proposals of
genetic relationship that turn received notions upside down (e.g.\ Sino-Mayan,
Sino-Caucasian, Sino-Austronesian, Japanese-Dravidian), and which can lead the
unwary down fruitless paths, obscuring the differences among cognates,
borrowings, and chance resemblances.\footnote{See Matisoff 1990a (“On
megalocomparison”).  Megalocomparison has the apparent advantage of
non-falsifiability, since, as Haudricourt has observed, one can never prove that
any two languages are not related. But non-falsifiable hypotheses are not
scientific. When presented with alternative non-falsifiable proposals it is
impossible to choose among them.}  Various tricks of analysis that I have lumped
under the rubric of “proto-form stuffing” can help the Nostraticist or
Sino-Mayanist convince himself that his fantastical comparisons are “perfectly
regular”. Paradigmatically, one can multiply the number of proto-phonemes. If
you reconstruct 35 proto-vowels, any anomalous vowel correspondence can be
regarded as “regularly reflecting” a separate proto-vowel.  Syntagmatically, if
you reconstruct etyma like \textbf{*mrgsla,} and the monstrous proto-cluster
\textbf{*mrgsl-}
occurs only in a single etymon, any set of reflexes in the daughter languages
can be said to be “regular”.\footnote{This is actually the proto-form offered
in Weidert 1981:25 for an etymon meaning ‘spirit, ghost, shadow’ (reconstructed
as \textbf{*m-hla} in \textit{STC} \#475). As I have observed (Matisoff 1982:22), “It is always
possible and sometimes necessary to invent an \textit{ad hoc} explanation for an
anomalous case. It is even true that some such \textit{ad hoc} ‘solutions’ are more
plausible than others. The only harm is in deluding oneself that an explanation
which covers only a single case establishes a ‘regularity’.”}


The time-depth of PST is perhaps 6000 years B.P., about at the limits of the
comparative method. We can hardly afford to insist on “perfect regularity” of
correspondence among our putative cognates.  But instead of resorting to
“proto-form stuffing” to try to explain away problems, what is needed is an
explicit theory of variational phenomena.  TB and ST etyma, like those of other
language families, are not independent isolated entities, but stand in complex
phonosemantic relationships with each other.  It has been recognized for a long
time that words in Chinese and TB languages participate in morphophonemic groups
of partially resemblant forms that have been called “word families”.\footnote{See the pioneering study of Karlgren (1933), “Word families in Chinese”.}  In
Matisoff 1978 (\textit{VSTB}) I developed the notion of the \textit{allofam},
or individual member
of a word-family, and advocated the formulation of “allofamic reconstructions”
that accommodated all the well-attested variants deemed to descend from the same
proto-word-family.  The symbol \STEDTU{⪤} was introduced to symbolize an allofamic
relationship between variant forms, i.e., “A \STEDTU{⪤} B” means that “A and B are
synchronic allofams of each other”, while “*A \STEDTU{⪤} *B” means that there is a
word-family relationship between A and B at the proto-level.\footnote{This
symbol \STEDTU{⪤}, a combination of  >  ‘goes to’ and < ‘comes from’, is meant to suggest
that neither variant is necessarily deemed to have temporal priority, but that
both must be set up to account for attested forms.}


Needless to say, extreme care must be used in claiming that different forms
are variants of the same etymon.  Allofamic theory must be applied in a
controlled and constrained way.\footnote{See the extended discussion in Ch.~XII
of \textit{HPTB} (pp.~491-534), “Allofamic variation in  rhymes”.} Not everything may be
said to vary with everything else! It is sometimes quite difficult to decide
whether partially resemblant forms represent separate etyma or whether they are
merely allofams of the same word-family.  Not only must each proto-allofam fit
our canonic template (above 2.2), but the type of variation posited must be
abundantly replicated in other examples.  This volume does not attempt to
conceal such uncertainties, but frequently entertains the possibility that etyma
set up as independent might actually be co-allofams, or \textit{vice versa}. 

The best attested patterns of variation in ST/TB are all exemplified in the
etymologies of this volume.  They include the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item %(a)
Voicing vs.\ voicelessness of the initial consonant:\footnote{Nothing is
more common in TB word families than variation of voicing in initial consonants,
largely due to the pervasive influence of prefixes on the manner of the initial.
 This is in sharp contrast to the situation in Indo-European, where such
variation in manner is quite rare, and is usually not tolerated in PIE
reconstructions.}\nopagebreak[4]

As some of the above examples illustrate, some roots show more than one type
of variation.  When a posited allofamic reconstruction (e.g.\ \textbf{*sir} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*sit} (6)
EGG) does not fall into a well-attested variational category, I comment on it. 
Handel makes similar remarks with respect to some of my TB comparisons with OC.


Occasionally, when the phonosemantic variation among the allofams is
considerable, and when each variant is amply attested, I split up the
presentation of the data into subroots that are designated by the same number
but with different lower case letters, e.g.: \textbf{*p-wu} (1) EGG is split into \textbf{*wu}
(1a) and \textbf{*pu} (1b);
\textbf{*m/s-la(ː)y} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*s-tay} (40) NAVEL/CENTER/SELF is split into
\textbf{*m/s-la(ː)y} (40a) and \textbf{*s-tay} (40b);
\textbf{*m-ley} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*m-li} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*m-ney} (114) PENIS is
broken down into \textbf{*m-ley} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*m-li} (114a)
and \textbf{*m-ney} (114b).


As I put it 35 years ago, “We must steer an Aristotelian middle path between
a dangerous speculativism and a stodgy insensitivity to the workings of
variational phenomena in language history.”\footnote{Matisoff 1972b (“Tangkhul
Naga and comparative TB”), p.~282.}

\subsection{Regularity and exceptions}

Exceptionlessness vs. parallel examples.1  How many parallel examples do we need to establish “regularity”?  Are exceptions more to be tolerated in “core” than in “peripheral” vocabulary? In very favorable circumstances we might find several parallel examples that prove the validity of a correspondence that at first glance seemed most unlikely. See Figure XYZ.

. Patterns of phonosemantic variation in Tibeto-Burman vs. Indo-European3

Every spoken language is rife with variation on both the phonological and semantic planes, some of it rule-governed and some of it sporadic. Thus, despite the qualms of certain extreme neogrammarians, we must assume that this is true for proto-languages as well. 

·Manners of initial consonants
In ST/TB variation in the manner of articulation (voiced or not, aspirated or not) of initial consonants is commonplace, largely due to the effect of prefixes. This is not so in Indo-European or Austronesian, where a voicing discrepancy can be a fatal objection to an etymology.
·Vocalic alternations
Conversely, vowel alternations (“ablaut” or “gradations”) are thoroughgoing and well-structured in IE, but quite sporadic in ST/TB, either confined to particular languages (e.g. Written Tibetan), or due merely to phonetic factors, without semantic content (e.g. alternation between medial -i-  ? -u-, especially in the environment of a labial Ci and/or Cf.  Even less phonetically motivated is the variation between -i- ? -ya- found in several roots, notably EYE *mik  ? *myak.  Very occasionally a single etymon exhibits both types of alternation, e.g. BODY HAIR *mul  ? *mil  ?  *myal.
·Variation between homorganic final stops and nasals
This is common both in Chinese and TB, perhaps due to the influence of suffixes which have since disappeared; but this phenomenon is unknown in IE.  See Fig. XYZ, above (SCATTER/POUR).
·Variation in the prefixes attested with a given root
This is extremely common in TB, partly because prefixes may arise from the reduction of the first syllables of compounds (see ANT in Fig. XYZ above), and also because certain TB languages seem to prefer a particular prefix to generalize throughout large parts of the lexicon.  Consonantal prefixes play a very minor role in IE etymologies. The only example I can think of is the sigma mobile, a prefixal s- that appears with a certain root in some languages but not in others (e.g. SNOW: PIE *sneig?h-, which gives, e.g. Russian sneg, but Latin nix/nivis). [BUT THIS IS THE REGULAR DEVELOPMENT OF *SN- IN LATIN.]

In as many as 20 TB etymologies, some languages have a labial stop while others have w- (even though the “regular” correspondences are between  stops and stops and semivowels and semivowels); e.g. PIG WT phag/WB wak.  This phenomenon, which I have called “extrusional”, occurs mostly before the vowel -a-.4
·Tonal variations
Nothing is more common than for a ST/TB etymon to show tonal variation, either within a single language, or within a single subgroup, or across subgroups.  These variations may be highly structured, even rule-governed (with clear conditioning), or they may be quite sporadic. Nevertheless tones usually do correspond very well within a subgroup, so that tonal anomalies must receive special attention. Tonally impoverished IE, on the other hand, must do without this sort of correspondence (except perhaps with respect to the pitch accents of Greek and Sanskrit, which sometimes do correspond regularly).

Here is a PAF (in vertical format) which illustrates several of the types of variation just mentioned:
BELLY/STOMACH
			p
		*s-		u
			b		(?)	(k)
		*?-		i
			w
	
·Root extensions/augments in final position
One variational feature shared by both TB and IE is the phenomenon of extra consonants tacked onto the end of a root, with no clear reason for it.  First a couple of examples from TB:

		
TONGUE/LICK
							(w)
	
		*m-
							(y)
			l	(y)	a	(?)	

		  s-					(m)

	
							(k)










FIRE/BURN/KINDLE/ROAST5

			*p			r

				w		l
			 b		a	
				y		m, n, ?
						
			 h			t


A very similar example from Indo-European involves the morpheme *wer- TURN/BEND, called “the conventional basis of various Indo-European roots” (AHD: 76-77). See Figure XYZ.

V. More on the concept of word family: blood relatives vs. adoptive ones

According to the broad definition of “word family” adopted at STEDT, a family may include “blood relatives” (i.e. native words directly descended from an earlier stage of a given language), as well as words borrowed from a related language (“adoptive relatives”). It is the task of the analyst to distinguish these two types of family members. In TB, this problem is often acute, e.g. with respect to the Baic languages of Yunnan, which have been overwhelmed with different strata of loanwords from Chinese over the millennia.  Indo-European also has countless examples of this mixed type of word family, as in Figure XYZ.

\subsection{Rectification/revision of reconstructions}

As of January 2014, about XYZ% of our etymologies have gone through the rectification process. We shall complete this task during the year-long no-cost extension of the current STEDT grants.

We have nothing to apologize for in changing our reconstructions (look at all the revisions of Baxter/Sagart!). In our case, we’re not just rechewing the same old data in ever more implausible ways, but rather trying to accommodate all the new data that keep pouring in. 
In cases where the reconstructions in this Final Product differ from those in HPTB or other previous publications, the FP wins (providing the etymon has been properly rectified).

\subsection[Etymological accuracy and rectification of possible errors]{Etymological accuracy and rectification of possible errors}

There are all too many ways in which one can make etymological mistakes, and
I have been guilty of all of them at one time or another.\footnotemark A rough taxonomy of
errors would have to include the following:

\footnotetext{The discussion in this section is adapted from \textit{HPTB}, pp.~538-40.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Treating a loanword as native

I was at first delighted when I ran across the Jingpho form \textbf{wéʔ-wū} ‘screw’,
since its first syllable looked like an excellent match with Lahu \textbf{ɔ̀-vɛ̀ʔ} ‘id.’,
for which I then had no etymology. Could this be a precious example of the rare
PTB rhyme \textbf{*-ek}? But the screw is hardly an artifact of any great antiquity, and
it would be \textit{prima facie} implausible that a root with such a meaning would have
existed in PTB. The truth quickly became apparent. The modern Burmese form for
‘screw’, \textbf{wɛ́ʔ-ʔu} (WB \textbf{wak-ʔu}), the obvious source from which both Jingpho and
Lahu borrowed these words, means literally “pig-intestine”.  The semantic
association is the corkscrew-like appearance of a pig’s small intestine. This
etymology is also interesting from the viewpoint of distinguishing native vs.\
borrowed co-allofams. The usual, native words for ‘pig’ in Jingpho and Lahu are
\textbf{wàʔ} and \textbf{vàʔ}, respectively; but the doublets borrowed from Burmese have front
vowels, as in spoken Burmese. Unless a native speaker of Jingpho knows Burmese,
s/he is unlikely to realize that the first syllable of \textbf{wéʔ-wū} means ‘pig’,
especially since this syllable is in the high-stopped tone, while ‘pig’ is
low-stopped. The native Lahu speaker is even less likely to recognize the source
of \textbf{ɔ̀-vɛ̀ʔ}, since the morpheme for ‘intestine’ has been completely dropped from
the original Burmese compound, rather like the way our word \textit{camera} (< Lat.\
‘room; chamber; vaulted enclosure’) is a shortening of the old compound \textit{camera
obscura} (“dark chamber”).\footnote{There is a difference in detail between the
two cases, however: the deleted ‘intestine’ is the head of the compound
“pig-intestine”, but the deleted \textit{obscura} is the modifier in the collocation
“dark-chamber”.}

\item Combining reflexes of unrelated roots

When two forms bearing a semantic resemblance in a phonologically depleted
language differ only in tone, it is tempting to try to relate them. I once
entertained the possibility that such pairs of Lahu forms as \textbf{phu} ‘silver, money’
/ \textbf{phû} ‘price, cost’ and \textbf{mu} ‘high, tall’ / \textbf{mû} ‘sky’ were co-allofams, though they
can easily be shown to descend from quite separate etyma: \textbf{phu} < PTB \textbf{*plu} (\textit{STC} p.
89) / \textbf{phû} < PTB \textbf{*pəw} (\textit{STC} \#41);
\textbf{mu} < PTB \textbf{*mraŋ} (\textit{STC} p.~43) / \textbf{mû} < PTB \textbf{*r-məw}
(\textit{STC} \#488).\footnote{See Matisoff 1973b (\textit{GL}:29); such speculations were debunked in
the 2nd Printing (1982) of \textit{GL}, p.~675.}

\item Failure to recognize that separately reconstructed etyma are really co-allofams

An opposite type of error is to overlook the etymological identity between sets
of forms, assigning them to separate etyma when they are really co-allofams.
Thus \textit{STC} sets up two independent PTB roots, both with the shape \textbf{*dyam}, one
meaning ‘full; fill’ (\textit{STC} \#226) and the other glossed as ‘straight’ (\textit{STC} \#227).
Yet it can be shown that the latter root also means ‘flat’, and that all
reflexes of \#226 and \#227 may be subsumed under a single etymon, with the
underlying idea being “perfection in a certain dimension”.\footnote{See Matisoff
1988b:4-9.}


Similarly, I was slow to recognize that two roots I had set up separately,
PLB \textbf{*dzay²} ‘cattle; domestic animal’ (Matisoff 1985a \#129)
and Kamarupan \textbf{*tsaːy} ‘elephant;
cattle’ (\#143) are really one and the same.\footnote{I have argued that a
third root set up in Matisoff 1985a (\textit{GSTC} \#106), \textbf{*(t)saːy} \STEDTU{⪤} \textbf{*(d)zaːy} ‘temperament / aptitude
/talent’, is also related, the common notion being ‘property (either material or
intellectual)’. See Matisoff 1985a:44-45; 1988b:10-13.}

\item Double-dipping

This embarrassing situation occurs when an author inadvertently assigns the same
form in a daughter language to two different etyma, perhaps within the pages of
the same book, but more likely in separate articles. At different times I have
compared Chinese \textbf{chún} \TC{唇} ‘lip’ (OC \textbf{d̑i̯wən}) to both PTB \textbf{*dyal}
and \textbf{*m-ts(y)ul}, finally deciding in favor of the latter.\footnote{See \textit{HPTB}
9.2.1, 9.22(4), 9.2.4.}  It
is of course perfectly legitimate to change one’s mind, as long as one explains
why. The best course is to present the alternative etymologies together,
inviting the reader to choose between them.

\item Misanalyses of compounds

A vast number of words in TB languages are di- or tri-syllabic compounds, a fact
which greatly complicates the task of etymologization.  Many traps lie in wait
for the analyst, leading to potential errors of several kinds.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Wrong segmentation

This can happen when a form in an inadequately transcribed source is not
syllabified.  The Pochury and Sangtam forms for ‘star’, transcribed as \textbf{awutsi}
and \textbf{chinghi}, respectively, in the little glossaries compiled by the
\textit{Nagaland
Bhasha Parishad},\footnote{Kumar et al., \textit{Hindi Pochury English Dictionary} (1972);
\textit{Hindi
Sangtam English Dictionary} (1973). Kohima: Linguistic Circle of Nagaland.}
 should
be segmented as \textbf{a-wu-tsi} and \textbf{ching-hi},
and not as \textbf{a-wut-si} and \textbf{chi-nghi}, as I
imprudently did in Matisoff 1980:21.


\item Misunderstanding the meaning of a constituent

A special case of this problem is mistaking an affix for a root, especially
likely to occur when no grammatical description exists for a language. Several
Naga languages have dissyllabic forms for ‘moon’ with similar final syllables,
e.g.\ Chang \textbf{litnyu}, Konyak \textbf{linnyu},
Phom \textbf{linnyü}, Sangtam \textbf{chonu}, Liangmai \textbf{chahiu}.
Yet these final elements do not constitute a new root meaning ‘moon’, as I had
originally guessed; rather they represent an abstract formative, ultimately
grammaticalized from a root \textbf{*n(y)u} ‘mother’, that occurs in nouns from all sorts
of semantic fields (e.g.\ Chang \textbf{chinyu} ‘center’,
\textbf{henyu} ‘ladder’, \textbf{lamnyu} ‘road’,
\textbf{pinyu} ‘snake’).\footnote{See Matisoff 1980 (“Stars, moon, spirits”), p.\ 35;
for the
suffixal use of morphemes meaning ‘mother’, see Matisoff 1991b (“The mother of all
morphemes”).}


\item Choosing the wrong syllable of a compound for an etymology

This can happen when two different syllables of a compound are phonologically
similar, especially if one is dealing with a poorly known language with depleted
final consonants, e.g.\ forms like Guiqiong Ganzi \textbf{tʃhə⁵⁵sɑ̃⁵⁵}
and Ersu \textbf{ʂɿ⁵⁵ji⁵⁵} ‘otter’.
Which syllables are to be ascribed to PTB \textbf{*sram}? 
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

interactivity
Final Product is of course not final at all!


\subsection{Philosophical ruminations}

Both phonological and semantic reconstructions are arts as well as sciences, arts which require a feel for proto-languages (what I have called Proto-Sprachgefühl), as well as a commitment to “steer an Aristotelian middle path betwen a dangerous speculativism and a stodgy insensitivity to the workings of variational phenomena in language history.”1 

We Tibeto-Burmanists need not apologize to Indo-Europeanists, or be envious of them. Even relative neophytes can make important discoveries in our field, which is a maximal contrast with the cutthroat world of Indo-European, where you can spend your whole life defending a single “new” etymology.

I much prefer the maxim Errare humanum est to the dreadful judgment Falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus.

It is admirable to correct one’s own mistakes, both typographical and analytical. We should indeed suffer from our errors, but also correct them at every opportunity. As STEDT goes off into the twilight, we are doing all we can to “rectify” our etymologies, accepting most of them without modification, but also revising many others, and throwing out a relatively small number of them altogether.

Although it is admirable to change one’s mind for good reason, it is frivolous to change one’s reconstructions just for the sake of being different.

It is admirable to evaluate the reconstructions of others critically, and to offer better alternatives if possible. But it is frivolous to make trivial changes in previously established reconstructions simply in order to call them one’s own.

Cumulativity vs. perpetual revolution. Don’t throw out the baby with the bath-water. It is better to build on previous etymological work, rather than attempting to tear it all down and start over. Avoid Freudian patricidalism.

Do not be discouraged as you stumble along from one half-truth to another in this marvelous enterprise we call etymologization.

Etymology is an art as much as a science. But just as in any art, there are better and worse practitioners. We owe it to the field to be responsible and to hold ourselves to the highest standards of intellectual 
honesty and collegiality.

As STEDT goes off into the twilight, there are hopes that it will continue in a more 21st century way.  Creation of an international consortium: the interactive “Root Canal”.

\section{Conclusion}
One cannot very well end a book with the word ``horse-leech'', and so a few concluding philosophical remarks seem appropriate. Perhaps the best way to organize this discussion is in terms of a set of adjectives with the -ive suffix.
\subsection{Cumulative}
In linguistics as in other disciplines, it is a constant temptation to try to overthrow the work of one's predecessors, so that one's own research will appear to be the {\it fons et origo} of the truth.\footnote{I have referred to this phenomenon in Freudian terms as ``patricidal'' (keynote address at the Summer Institute of the Linguistic Society of America, Ann Arbor 1973).}
This tendency has been especially characteristic of generative grammar, where ``theories of language'' have a built-in planned obsolescence, with each new theory claiming to invalidate all previous ones.

Historical linguists are hardly exempt from this primal urge for revolutionary novelty  the desire to be different just for the sake of being different. This can take many forms, some of them trivial and innocuous, like replacing a phonetic symbol in a previous reconstruction by a new but equivalent one; or changing the name of a subgroup of a language family.\footnote{Hence the proliferation of alternate names even for well-established subgroups like Lolo-Burmese (Burmese-Lolo, Yi-Burmese, Burmese-Yi, Burmese-Yipho, Yi-Myanmar, Myanmar-Yipho, etc.). T. Shintani has recently (2002) proposed the euphonious neologism ``Brakaloungic'' for Karenic.}
More serious is the itch to carve out totally novel subgroupings,\footnote{I have called this ``neosubgroupitis'' (JAM 2000b ``On Sino-Bodic''). Trying to establish higher-order combinations of TB subgroups is premature at best. Even Indo-Europeanists are still unable to do so unequivocally for their much better documented family. See the discussion in JAM 1978a (VSTB):1-12.} a process rather similar to the decennial gerrymandering of congressional districts in the House of Representatives. At an extreme level we find ``megalocomparative'' proposals of genetic relationship that turn received notions upside down (e.g. Sino-Mayan, Sino-Caucasian, Sino-Austronesian, Japanese-Dravidian), and which can lead the unwary down fruitless paths, obscuring the differences among cognates, borrowings, and chance resemblances.\footnote{See JAM 1990a (“On megalocomparison”). Megalocomparison has the apparent advantage of non-falsifiability, since, as Haudricourt has observed, one can never prove that any two languages are not related. But non-falsifiable hypotheses are not scientific. When presented with alternative non-falsifiable proposals it is impossible to choose among them.}

Perpetual revolution gets to be fatiguing after a while.\footnote{As Leon Trotsky found to his cost in 1940.} Surely it is preferable to build on the past rather than to repudiate it. Historical linguistics is a cumulative enterprise. Thanks to the foundation laid by pioneering scholars, especially Paul K. Benedict, a solid body of TB/ST etymological knowledge has been accumulated, in terms of which new etymologies must be evaluated. No longer can one get away with reconstructing whatever one pleases, no matter how typologically bizarre or adhoc or mechanistic the reconstruction might be.\footnote{Those who lack what I have called “Proto-Sprachgefühl” (JAM 1982a) can produce reconstructions bristling with strange symbols but devoid of any phonetic or typological plausibility; see e.g. Sedláček 1970; Weidert 1975, 1979, 1981, 1987; Peiros \& Starostin 1996.}

There is a dialectical relationship between synchronic data and sound laws. The ``laws'' are derived by inference from the data in the first place, but once proto-forms are reconstructed, they can be used to guide us in our hunt for cognates in languages not yet examined (even if they have undergone semantic change). Almost every TB/ST etymology so far proposed presents problems and complications  irregularities  in some language or other, which is par for the course even in the much better known Indo-European family. Part of our task is to indicate where the exceptions, problems, and irregularities lie, in the hope that they can ultimately be explained.

The concept of ``regularity'' itself is by no means simple, nor does it mean the same thing to different scholars.\footnote{See JAM 1992 (“Following the marrow”) and 1994a (“Regularity and variation”).} The Nostraticist or Sino-Mayanist can convince himself that his fantastical comparisons are ``perfectly regular''. Given sufficient semantic latitude and proto-forms that are complex enough, one can formulate ``sound laws'' in such a way that they appear exceptionless. Paradigmatically one can multiply the number of proto-phonemes. If you reconstruct 35 proto-vowels, any anomalous vowel correspondence can be regarded as ``regularly reflecting'' a separate proto-vowel. Syntagmatically, if you reconstruct etyma like *mrgsla, and the monstrous proto-cluster *mrgsl- occurs only in a single etymon, any set of reflexes in the daughter languages can be said to be ``regular''.\footnote{This is actually the proto-form offered in Weidert 1981:25 for an etymon meaning ‘spirit, ghost, shadow’ (reconstructed as *m-hla in STC \#475). As I have observed, “It is always possible and sometimes necessary to invent an ad hoc explanation for an anomalous case. It is even true that some such ad hoc ‘solutions’ are more plausible than others. The only harm is in deluding oneself that an explanation which covers only a single case establishes a ‘regularity’.” (JAM 1982a:22).}

As the alternative to such ``proto-form stuffing'', one must have recourse to proto-variation, though in a controlled and constrained way. Not everything may be said to vary with everything else.\footnote{This issue is the major theme of JAM 1978a (VSTB).} This Handbook places special emphasis on variational patterns in TB/ST, and attempts to classify them according to how well attested they are.\footnote{Note the large percentage of PTB roots for which proto-variation is posited in the Index of Proto-Forms, below.} As I put it 30 years ago, ``We must steer an Aristotelian middle path between a dangerous speculativism and a stodgy insensitivity to the workings of variational phenomena in language history.''\footnote{JAM 1972b (“Tangkhul Naga and comparative TB”):282.}

The time-depth of PST is perhaps 6000 years B.P., about at the limits of the comparative method. We can hardly afford to insist on ``perfect regularity'', though we must never settle for a roseate Greenbergian haze.\footnote{See Greenberg 1987, and my review of it (JAM 1990a).}

\subsection{Self-corrective}
A few of our etyma are only set up provisionally, and some individual forms are assigned only tentatively to a certain etymon. It must be admitted that a lot of guesswork is involved in etymologizing material from hundreds of languages and dialects at once, without having established the ``soundlaws'' in advance. The problems are especially acute when comparing phonologically depleted languages with those having richer syllable canons. When there is a partial phonological similarity between distinct etyma with the same meaning (e.g. *sem and *sak `mind / breath'; *muːr and *muk Ðmouth'; *s-maːy and *s-mel `face'; *s-r(y)ik and *s(y)ar `louse'), it is not easy to decide by simple inspection to which etymon we should assign a phonologically slight form in a daughter language (e.g. sɒ `mind', mɔ `mouth', hmɛ `face').\footnote{See JAM 1994a (“Regularity and variation”):54-55.}

There are all too many ways in which one can make etymological mistakes. A rough taxonomy of errors would have to include the following:Treating a loanword as nativeI was at first delighted when I ran across the Jingpho form wéʔ-wu `screw', since its first syllable looked like an excellent match with Lahu ɔ̀-vɛ̀ʔ `id.', for which I then had no etymology. Could this be a precious example of the rare PTB rhyme *-ek ?\footnote{See above, 8.4(1).}
But the screw is hardly an artifact of any great antiquity, and it would be prima facie implausible that a root with such a meaning would have existed in PTB. The truth quickly became apparent. The modern Burmese form for `screw', wɛ́ʔ-ʔu (WB wak-ʔu), the obvious source from which both Jingpho and Lahu borrowed these words, means literally ``pig-intestine''. The semantic association is the squiggly corkscrew-like appearance of a pig's small intestine.\footnote{See the photographs of a pig being butchered in a Lahu village in JAM 1978a, between pp. 168 and 169. This same semantic association is to be found with the root *riːl, above 9.3.2(3).} This etymology is also interesting from the viewpoint of distinguishing native vs. borrowed co-allofams. The usual, native words for `pig' in Jingpho and Lahu are wàʔ and vàʔ, respectively; but the doublets borrowed from Burmese have front vowels, as in spoken Burmese. Unless a native speaker of Jingpho knows Burmese, s/he is unlikely to realize that the first syllable of wéʔ-wu means `pig', especially since this syllable is in the high-stopped tone, while `pig' is low-stopped. The native Lahu speaker is even less likely to recognize the source of ɔ̀-vɛ̀ʔ, since the morpheme for `intestine' has been completely dropped from the original Burmese compound,\footnote{The Lahu cognate to WB ʔu ‘intestine’ is ɣù (usually in the compound ɔ̀-ɣù-tɛ̂ʔ).} rather like the way our word camera (< Lat. `room; chamber; vaulted enclosure') is a shortening of the old compound camera obscura (``dark chamber'').\footnote{There is a difference in detail between the two cases, however: the deleted ‘intestine’ is the head of the compound “pig-intestine”, but the deleted obscura is the modifier in the collocation “dark-chamber”.}

\subsection{Combining reflexes of unrelated roots}
When two forms bearing a semantic resemblance in a phonologically depleted language differ only in tone, it is tempting to try to relate them. I once entertained the possibility that such pairs of Lahu forms as phu `silver, money' / phˆu `price, cost' and mu `high, tall' / mû `sky' were co-allofams, though they can easily be shown to descend from quite separate etyma: phu < PTB *plu (STC p. 89) / phû < PTB *pəw (STC \#41); mu < PTB *mraŋ (STC p. 43) / mû < PTB *r-məw (STC \#488).\footnote{See JAM 1973b (GL:29); such speculations were debunked in the 2nd Printing (1982) of GL, p. 675.}

\subsubsection{Failure to recognize that separately reconstructed etyma are really co-allofams}
An opposite type of error is to overlook the etymological identity between sets of forms, assigning them to separate etyma when they are really co-allofams. Thus STC sets up two independent PTB roots, both with the shape *dyam, one meaning `full; fill' (STC \#226) and the other glossed as `straight' (STC \#227). Yet it can be shown that the latter root also means `flat', and that all reflexes of \#226 and \#227 may be subsumed under a single etymon, with the underlying idea being ``perfection in a certain dimension''.\footnote{See JAM 1988a:4-9, and above 3.4.2(c), 7.5(6).} Similarly, I was slow to recognize that two roots I had set up separately, PLB *dzay² `cattle; domestic animal' (GSTC \#129) and Kamarupan *tsaːy `elephant; cattle' (GSTC \#143) are really one and the same.\footnote{I have argued that a third root set up in GSTC (\#106), *(t)saːy \& *(d)zaːy ‘temperament / aptitude / talent’, is also related, the common notion being ‘property (either material or intellectual)’. See JAM 1985a:44-45; 1988a:10-13; and above 5.5.2(1b), 5.5.2(2).}

\subsubsection{Double-dipping}
This embarrassing situation occurs when an author inadvertently assigns the same form in a daughter language to two different etyma, perhaps within the pages of the same book, but more likely in separate articles.\footnote{The computer can be very useful in deciding between alternative etymologies. Once “sound-laws” have been formulated, computer checking can test whether a particular reconstruction follows the laws, identifying inconsistencies in the reflexes of the same proto-element in a given language. Such a methodology has been applied to the Tamangic languages, using the “reconstruction engine” developed by J.B. Lowe at STEDT in collaboration with Martine Mazaudon and Boyd Michailovsky during their sojourns at Berkeley as visiting scholars (1987-89, 1990-91).} At different times I have compared Chinese 唇 `lip' (OC d̑i̯wən) to both PTB *dyal (above 9.2.1) and *m-ts(y)ul, finally deciding in favor of the latter (above 9.22(4), 9.2.4). It is perfectly legitimate to change one's mind, as long as one explains why. The best course is to present the alternative etymologies together, inviting the reader to choose between them.

\subsubsection{Misanalyses of compounds}
A vast number of words in TB languages are di- or tri-syllabic compounds, a fact which greatly complicates the task of etymologization.\footnote{See JAM 1978a (VSTB):58-72.} Many traps lie in wait for the analyst, leading to potential errors of several kinds, all of which I have been guilty of at one time or another:

\paragraph{Wrong segmentation}
This can happen when a form in an inadequately transcribed source is not syllabified. The Pochury and Sangtam forms for `star', transcribed as awutsi and chinghi, respectively, in the little glossaries compiled by the Nagaland Bhasha Parishad,\footnote{Hindi Pochury English Dictionary (1972); Hindi Sangtam English Dictionary (1973). Kohima: Linguistic Circle of Nagaland.} should be segmented as a-wu-tsi and ching-hi, and not as a-wut-si and chi-nghi, as I imprudently did in JAM 1980:21.

\paragraph{Misunderstanding the meaning of a constituent}
A special case of this problem is mistaking an affix for a root, especially likely to occur when no grammatical description exists for a language. Several Naga languages have dissyllabic forms for `moon' with similar final syllables, e.g. Chang litnyu, Konyak linnyu, Phom linnyü, Sangtam chonu, Liangmai chahiu. Yet these final elements do not constitute a new root meaning `moon', as I had originally guessed; rather they represent an abstract formative, ultimately grammaticalized from a root *n(y)u `mother', that occurs in nouns from all sorts of semantic fields (e.g. Chang chinyu `center', henyu `ladder', lamnyu `road', pinyu `snake').\footnote{See JAM (“Stars, moon, spirits”)1980:35; for the suffixal use of morphemes meaning ‘mother’, see JAM 1991e.}

\paragraph{Choosing the wrong syllable of a compound for an etymology}
This can happen when two different syllables of a compound are phonologically similar, especially if one is dealing with a poorly known language with depleted final consonants, e.g. Guiqiong Ganzi tʃhə⁵⁵ sɒ̃⁵⁵ and Ersu ʂɿ⁵⁵ ji⁵⁵ `otter'. Which syllables are to be ascribed to PTB *sram ?\footnote{See above 7.1(1).}

\paragraph{Semantic leaps}
Deciding how much semantic latitude to allow among putative cognates is definitely an art rather than a science. Here as elsewhere a middle-of-the-road approach is necessary, neither overly conservative nor too wildly speculative. As a positive example of a promising new etymology involving a semantic leap, we may offer *m-t(s)i `salt / yeast'.\footnote{Above 3.3.1.} Phonologically the reflexes correspond perfectly well. On the other hand, the semantic association between `salt' and `yeast' has yet to be attested elsewhere, even though it has great initial plausibility. Both are efficacious substances that have dramatic effects on the taste of food or drink; their lack renders the food or drink insipid.\footnote{Yeast is used for brewing liquor rather than for baking bread in East and SE Asia.}

This attitude is encapsulated in the dreadful maxim {\it Falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus}.\footnote{ “If one thing is wrong, it’s all wrong.” This was the approach of Miller’s (1974) bitter review of STC, in which he tried to kill the Conspectus just as it was born. In my “rejection” of his “Conspectus inspection” I characterized his strategy as follows: (a) make some criticism of a particular point, no matter how trivial, irrelevant or obfuscatory; (b) claim that tout se tient, and that the entire work stands or falls on the point in question; (c) beat the point elaborately to death; (d) avoid any substantive comments by pleading lack of space (JAM 1975a:157).}

Historical linguists cannot afford to be too thin-skinned, as long as criticism is fair, constructive, and proportionate. As I have said in print, ``I ask nothing better than to be corrected.''\footnote{JAM 1985b (“Out on a limb”):422.} Or again, ``We can take comfort from our mistakes. Reconstruction of a proto-lexicon is a piecemeal process. It is hardly surprising that we stumble along from one half-truth to another, as we try to trace the [phonological and] semantic interconnections among our reconstructed etyma.

After all, a computerized etymological enterprise by its very nature is eminently revisable.

\subsection{Desiderative}
I am acutely aware of the incompleteness of this Handbook. As noted in the Preface, we still have a long way to go before comparative/historical TB/ST studies are as advanced as they deserve to be. Despite the quickening pace of research, our knowledge of the various branches of this multifarious family remains highly uneven. With a few important exceptions,\footnote{These bright spots include Proto-Karen (Haudricourt, Jones, Solnit), PNN (French), Proto-Tani (J. Sun), Proto-Tamangic (Mazaudon), Proto-Kiranti (Michailovsky), Proto-Central Chin (VanBik), Proto-Lolo-Burmese (Burling, Matisoff, Bradley). See the References.} reliable reconstructions at the subgroup level are not yet available, so that ``teleo-reconstruction'' has to be resorted to.\footnote{See Benedict 1973.} Many more roots remain to be reconstructed at all taxonomic levels of the family.

Much remains to be done on the Chinese side as well, and we seem destined for a period of flux until the dust settles and competing reconstructions have sorted themselves out.

A large lacuna in this Handbook is the lack of a systematic treatment of tone. This is not because the topic does not interest me, but rather because it merits a book-length treatment by itself. We are only just coming to appreciate the richness and variety of TB tone systems as more and more data become available.\footnote{For a rough typology of TB tone systems, see JAM 1999a. Weidert (1987) is an attempt to reduce all TB tone systems to a single proto-phonational contrast among clear, breathy, and creaky voice qualities, but is marred by an over-formalistic and disorganized presentation which renders it virtually incomprehensible. See the review by JAM (1994c).} The big questions are still open, especially the key issue of monogenesis vs. polygenesis: Can we reconstruct a single tonal system at the PTB level? At the PST level? If so, was this original system primarily phonational or melodic? Or are tonogenesis and tonoexodus cyclical processes, with tones having arisen repeatedly and independently in the various branches of TB, so that even if there was an ``original'' system, it can no longer be recovered?

All in all, it is hard not to be optimistic about the future of TB/ST linguistics, as fieldwork opportunities increase and new generations of talented researchers enter the discipline. Eventually it seems inevitable that scholars throughout the world will share their information more and more, granting mutual access to their databases for the common good. On the other hand, too many TB languages are endangered, and may well disappear before they have been adequately recorded.

In any case, ``the reconstruction of PTB is a noble enterprise, where a spirit of competitive territoriality is out of place. We should pool our knowledge and encourage each other to venture outside of our specialized niches, so that we begin to appreciate the full range of TB languages...''\footnote{JAM 1982a:41.}

\subsection{Looking toward the future of ST/TB studies}


Although I feel that we are entering a new era of etymological
responsibility in TB/ST studies—the bar has been raised, as it were—I am
not suggesting that we turn our fieldinto a “tough neighborhood” like that of
the Indo-Europeanists. In particular I hope we can avoid the \textit{“Gotcha!”}
attitude,\footnote{Non-American readers might need a word of explanation here. 
“Gotcha!” is an attempt to render the colloquial pronunciation of “(I’ve) got
you (now)!”, a triumphant phrase used by someone who feels he has won an
argument.} whereby if a single error, real or fancied, is found in an article or
book, the whole work is impugned. This attitude is encapsulated in the dreadful
maxim \textit{Falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus.}\footnote{“If one thing is wrong, it’s
all wrong.”} Historical linguists cannot afford to be too thin-skinned, as long
as criticism is fair, constructive, and proportionate. As I have said in print,
“I ask nothing better than to be corrected.”\footnote{Matisoff 1985b:422 (“Out
on a limb”).}  Or again, “We can take comfort from our mistakes. Reconstruction
of a proto-lexicon is a piecemeal process. It is hardly surprising that we
stumble along from one half-truth to another, as we try to trace the
[phonological and] semantic interconnections among our reconstructed etyma. We
should not be discouraged if we barge off down blind alleys occasionally, or if
the solution to one problem raises as many questions as it answers.”\footnote{Matisoff 1988a:13.} After all, a computerized etymological enterprise by its
very nature is eminently revisable.  The reconstructive process by its very
nature is provisional and open-ended.  Our STEDT etymologies undergo a constant
process of “rectification”, and may be roughly divided into three types: (a)
those to be accepted as is; (b) those to be accepted with modifications; (c)
those to be rejected.  As with all scientific hypotheses, our reconstructions
are falsifiable in the light of new data or better analyses.


We still have a long way to go before comparative/historical TB studies are
as advanced as they deserve to be.  Despite the quickening pace of research, our
knowledge of the various branches of this multifarious family remains highly
uneven. With a few important exceptions mentioned above, reliable
reconstructions at the subgroup level are not yet available.  Many more roots
remain to be reconstructed at all taxonomic levels of the family. Much remains
to be done on the Chinese side as well, and we seem destined for a period of
flux until the dust settles and competing reconstructions of OC have sorted
themselves out.


Nevertheless, it is hard not to be optimistic about the future of TB/ST
linguistics, as fieldwork opportunities increase and new generations of talented
researchers enter the discipline. Eventually it seems inevitable that scholars
throughout the world will share their information more and more, granting mutual
access to their databases for the common good. On the other hand, too many TB
languages are endangered, and may well disappear before they have been
adequately recorded. In any case, “the reconstruction of PTB is a noble
enterprise, where a spirit of competitive territoriality is out of place. We
should pool our knowledge and encourage each other to venture outside of our
specialized niches, so that we begin to appreciate the full range of TB
languages....”\footnote{Matisoff 1982:41.  There is nothing more satisfying
than to have inadequate data on a language of which one has no firsthand
knowledge corrected by a specialist in that language.  The STEDT project
has recently (summer of 2007) benefited tremendously from the kindness of K.P.
Malla, who edited all the Newar(i) forms in our database, identifying loanwords,
putting verbs into their proper citation forms, and correcting the transcription
of vowels and consonants used in our previous sources.}
