This is the "chiangmai" version of the STEDT database interface.

It uses the "legacy" approach: basic CGI, TableKit, and a minimal amount 
of javascript.

From a coding point of view it is nice because:

 * the tagging facilities have been removed. It is a read-only, browsing interface.
 * simple to code: everything is pretty much self-contained.
 * shows complete metadata tables (but has the nice joins to other tables)

To deploy it, just check out the repository to the server you want to run it one, copy the 
files into a web-server accessible, executable directory, and e.g.:

# check out working directory
$ svn co https://stedt.sourcerepo.com/stedt/sss/chiangmai chiangmai
[...]
# put the files someplace executable by the server
$ svn export chiangmai ~/public_html/chiangmai 
Export complete.
#
# we need SyllabificationStation.pm...
#
svn co https://stedt.sourcerepo.com/stedt/sss/printutils printutils
cp printutils/SyllabificationStation.pm public_html/chiangmai/
#
# optional: remove working directory
rm -rf printutils
rm -rf chiangmai

It should just work!
